Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients with previously untreated, stage III/IV NPC received induction bio-chemotherapy followed by IMRT. Induction chemotherapy consists of weekly P-FL (cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil) doublet (n= 17) or a triplet of P-FL-G (P-FL + gemcitabine, n= 7) or P-FL-D (P-FL + docetaxel, n= 1) for a total of 10-12 weeks. Cetuximab 400 mg/m^2 day 1, then 250 mg/m^2 were administered every week. IMRT 70 Gy/35 fractions were delivered to T1-3 lesions and 74 Gy/37 fractions or 76.8 Gy/64 fractions to the T4 tumor. Results: Baseline characteristics are median age= 44 year-old; male/female= 19/6; performance status ECOG 0/1= 13/12; stage III/IV= 12/13, and pathological type (WHO) IIa/IIb= 12/13. All patients tolerated induction bio-chemotherapy very well. Grade 3 toxicity included leucopenia (8.0%) and skin rashes (40.0%). There was no grade 4 toxicity. After induction bio-chemotherapy, we obtained 52.0% complete response rate and 48.0% partial response rate. Thirteen of 24 (54.2%) patients who received re-biopsy of the nasopharynx before IMRT were reported as no viable tumor. IMRT was performed smoothly with a median treatment time of 49 days (range 45-53). After a median follow-up of 21 months, we observed 4 treatment failures, all in distant sites. The 2-year rates overall survival, locoregional failure-free and distant failure-free survivals were 100%, 100%, and 80%, respectively. Conclusion: Induction chemotherapy plus concurrent weekly cetuximab followed by IMRT is a highly effective protocol with very low toxicity in advanced NPC.'},\n",

Materials and Methods: Twenty-one early-stage left breast cancer patients of Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center (KFSYSCC) were collected in this study. Based on the location of the tumor bed, 8 Upper Inner Quadrant (UIQ), 5 Upper Outer Quadrant (UOQ), 4 Central, 2 Lower Inner Quadrant (LIQ) and 2 Lower Outer Quadrant (LOQ) sites were classified. Two sets of CT images (right decubitus and supine position) were acquired. Homemade alpha-cradle with 20 degrees tilt and homemade immobilization device of legs were used for the right decubitus position while the routine treatment position with both arms raised and head turned to the opposite side of treatment side was set for the supine position. Heart dose (V_5, V_(10), V_(25) and mean dose) and lung dose (V_5, V_(10), V_(20) and mean dose) of right decubitus position were compared with those of supine position by using parameters of breast volume, Maximum Heart Distance (MHD), Maximum Heart Length (MHL) and Central Lung Distance (CLD) in the same condition of Planning Target Volume (PTV) coverage. Results: There was no correlation between breast volume and heart dose. Heart dose could be decreased by using right decubitus position because of decreased MHD and MHL. Under this condition, the maximum decreased mean heart dose, V_5, V_(10) and V_(25) were 48.2% ± 14.0%, 7.6% ± 6.0%, 4.2% ± 2.4% and 1.9% ± 1.3%, respectively. CLD was not always decreased in the right decubitus position compared to the supine position. Therefore, lung dose was not always decreased by using the right decubitus position. Heart dose was decreased effectively for tumor in the LIQ. Heart dose for tumor in the UIQ or UOQ was lower than that in other position. For tumor in the Central position, lung dose was a little bit increased by using the right decubitus position. The mean dose of lung was increased 16.4 cGy and the Dose-Volume value was increased within 1%. Conclusion: Heart dose can be decreased effectively by using right decubitus position.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: Cancer patients with intracranial metastasis were traditionally treated with bilateral-field (BF) technique for whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Planning BF is simple and saves both treatment and planning time. However, the relatively crude method suffers from lack of dose conformity and homogeneity. These two factors may increase the complications of normal tissue and hair loss. However, with current improved techniques, the rapid development of therapeutic planning systems and the development of new treatment technologies such as volume modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and field-in-field (FIF) techniques, the treatment quality of whole brain irradiation should be reconsidered. Materials and Methods: The contours of whole brain PTV and the critical organs of ten patients were determined by one radiation oncologist and checked by another one. Bilateral- fields whole brain treatment plans were created. At the same time, a pair of sub-fields from the BF plans were modified to MLCs to create FIF plans. All BF, FIF and VMAT plans for each patient had a prescribed dose of 30 Gy in 12 fractions. The global maximum dose, dose comformity, and dose homogeneity were calculated to the same level as the tumor coverage. All organ doses were normalized to a single biological equivalent dose of 2 Gy fractions. All data was analyzed with non-parametric statistics. Results: The average maximal doses (normalized to the prescribed dose) of BF, FIF and VMAT plans were 113.28% ± 1.62% (mean ± std), 108.33% ± 1.16% and 110.53% ± 0.25%. The mean conformity of BF, FIF and VMAT plans were 0.633 ± 0.033, 0.664 ± 0.023 and 0.853 ± 0.011. The mean homogeneity of BF, FIF and VMAT plans were 0.552 ± 0.166, 0.841 ± 0.150 and 0.284 ± 0.086. The VMAT regimen had a better dose conformity and therefore significantly reduced organ damage at the critical organs, such as spinal cord, optic nerve, parotid glands, cochleae, and posterior scalp. However, poor dose homogeneity also compromised organ dose endpoints (such as the brainstem, hippocampus and optic chiasm) with slightly elevated doses. Conclusions: The FIF treatment plan has the lowest percentage of maximum dose and the best dose homogeneity, so the FIF treatment plan could completely replace the BF treatment plan to improve the quality of whole-brain irradiation treatment. The better dose conformity for the VMAT treatment plan reduces organ complications outside the target area with somewhat worse homogeneity. Both FIF or VMAT can be used as a treatment option to improve the quality of life of patients with brain metastases.'},\n",

Materials and Methods: In this study, we enrolled nine indicated patients with brain metastasis to receive hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiotherapy in regional hospital in Southern Taiwan from 2016 to 2017. We conducted to compare two different treatment plans using the technique of volumetric modulated arc therapy. All patients were fixed with head mask and set up a head flexion angle of 30°, and then received computed tomography simulation. We analyzed the coplanar and non-coplanar treatment plan using therapy planning system (Philip Pinnacle Planning System Version 9.2). Dose constraints were set equally to compare homogeneity index and conformity index of the planning target volume (PTV), and organs at risk (OAR), including the hippocampus, eyes, lens, and optic nerves. Results: The results show two treatment plan all conform the dose-limited guideline of Radiotherapy Therapy Oncology Group 0933. The homogeneity and conformal index of two treatment plans, non-coplanar plan is better than coplanar plan (p＜0.05). The dose distribution of D_(2%), D_(98%), and D_(mean) of PTV between bilateral hippocampus, non-coplanar plan is more homogenous than coplanar counterpart and achieve statistical significance (p＜ 0.05). The dose of two plans in both hippocampus and hippocampus avoidance region is similar (p＞ 0.05). Other OAR in both two plans was also similar (p＞ 0.05). However, treatment time of the coplanar plan can be significantly shorter than the non-coplanar plan (p＜ 0.05). Conclusions: Our study concluded the non-coplanar plan is better than the coplanar plan. However, longer therapy time is needed in non-coplanar plan. Whether the longer therapy time might lead to patient's discomfort, then result to internal shift and set-up error. Ongoing study need to be further explored clinically.\"},\n",

Materials and Methods: The literature indicates that may affect setup errors including systematic error (Σ) and random error (σ). The factors to impact σ in radiotherapy may be caused by age of patient, gender, tumor site, body mass index (BMI), weight loss, cancer stage, and the status whether metastasis. In the study, we collected a total of 138 patients who received helical TomoTherapy® from 2013 to 2016 at a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. All patients received megavoltage computed tomography for daily therapy position checkup. A total of 4081 sets of images were collected for analysis of setup error. We calculate means, standard deviations of daily setup error of each patient in three axis directions (X, Y, Z-axis), three dimensional (3D) vector, and Y-axis (roll) rotation during the treatment. Then Σ and σ are derived from adopted equations in the literature. In the study we analyzed which to factors to influence setup error during treatment. The formula (2.5Σ+0.7σ) by the author van Herk et al. is proposed to recommend safety margin of PTV clinically. Results: The factors significantly affect daily setup error in X, Y, Z-axis, 3D vector, and Y-axis (roll) rotation were in groups of patient’s age (p= 0.05), tumor sites (p＜ 0.001), and BMI (p＜ 0.001). Single regression analysis in factors to affect 3D vector setup error, we found tumor sites, weight loss, and tumor stage to achieve statistical significance. Another single regression analysis in factors to affect Y-axis (roll) rotation setup error, we disclosed only tumor site to achieve statistical significance. After multiple regression model, we concluded tumor site is the only factor to influence setup error significantly (p＜ 0.001). In the study, we recommended wider safety margins of PTV are 5-11 mm in X, Y, Z- axes in chest, abdomen, pelvis, and prostate tumors. The safety margins are 5-8 mm and 5-6 mm in the age group of 70-89 and the BMI ≥25 respectively. Conclusion: The important factors to affect setup error are age of patient, tumor site, and BMI. In this study, we recommend the safety margin in PTV should be individualized based on these setup error factors in the clinical practice of helical TomoTherapy®.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is widely used as therapy for localized lung cancer or metastases. Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) is the most common technique used to estimate the internal motion of lung cancer tumors. The purpose of this study was to observe tumor motion with 4DCT image in SBRT patients. Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis. From September 2008 to March 2016; forty patients with proven pathology for lung cancer or pulmonary metastasis, treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy were included in this study. All patients underwent three dimensional (3D) and four dimensional (4D) CT scans. GTV_(3D) and GTV_(4D) were created from 3D and 4DCT scanning, respectively. The volume, position and other tumor parameters, included matching index (MI) and degree of inclusion (DI) between GTV_(3D) and GTV_(4D) were also compared in this study. Results: The tumor motion measured by comparison of different 4DCT phases was highest for the CC direction (mean 0.65 cm, median 0.40 cm, range 0.10 - 2.70 cm). The next highest was for the AP direction (mean 0.24 cm, median 0.20 mm, range 0 - 0.90 cm) then the LR direction (mean 0.15 cm, median 0.10 cm, range 0 - 0.40 cm). The mean motion vector was 0.44 ± 0.21 cm, 0.73 ± 0.45 cm and 1.35 ± 0.81 cm in upper, middle and lower lobes, respectively. This shows that tumors located in the lower lobe of the lung exhibited the greatest amount of motion, and the magnitude was usually greatest along the CC axis. The MI and DI in the lower lobe was significantly different from the upper and middle lobes (p ＜ 0.05). No clinical or anatomic factors were identified as being related to the magnitude of the tumor excursion, except for lobe location (p= 0.005). Conclusion: Respiration induced tumor motion is an important issue in high precision SBRT. Using 4DCT information can greatly improve the target definition for lung cancer. The respiratory management technique is necessary for middle and lower lung lobes tumors in our study according to The AAPM Task Group 76 report [11]. The tumor motion in all patients was anisotropic, the amplitude was significantly larger in the CC direction than in AP and LR directions. To avoid the target missing and reduce the normal tissue irradiated. The anisotropic margins of ITV were more appropriate than isotropic margin in lung tumor. The tumor movement in lower lobe tumors is obviously greater than in the upper and middle lobes, especially where tumors are adhered to the chest wall and diaphragm. The greater margin in the CC direction especially for lower lobe tumors should be added. To account the internal motions which arise from breathing, the 4DCT is necessary for lung tumor especially in SBRT patients.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Introduction: Recent studies have revealed that nanoscale structure (nanotopography) of extracellular matrix is an important regulator of cell biology. However, it remains unknown whether nanotopography regulates cancer cell behaviors upon exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Materials and Methods: Hepatoma cell lines and a squamous cell carcinoma cell line were cultured on nanopatterned polycaprolactone surfaces and were irradiated. Sphere formation was counted and expression of cancer stemness-related genes (Sox2, Nanog and Oct3/4) was measured with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: In this study, we showed that IR induced expression of stemness genes including Sox2, Nanog and Oct3/4 in several cancer cell lines. Growing J5 hepatoma cells on a square lattice of evenly-spaced nanopits made of polycaprolactone attenuates cancer stemness genes expression induced by IR. Growing J5 cells on a near-square lattice of nanopits has smaller effects on IR-induced cancer stemness genes expression. The phenomenon was reproducible in another cell line derived from squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusions: We provided experimental evidence that radiation-induced expression of cancer stemness genes in cancer cells is regulated by nanotopography of the attaching surface. Further research is warranted to analyze molecular interaction between integrin signaling and cancer stemness, as well as the implications for cancer radiotherapy.'},\n",

The overall means and standard deviations of the X, Y, and Z axes in α-cradle group and in vacuum bag group were 0.4 ± 1.8 mm and 0.3 ± 1.8 mm (p = 0.82), 0.6 ± 2.6 mm and 0.2 ±2.5 mm (p = 0.52), -0.6 ± 2.0 mm and 0 ± 1.5 mm (p = 0.15), respectively. The PTV safe margins in the X, Y, and Z axes of α-cradle group were 5.7 mm, 8.7 mm and 6.8 mm, respectively. The PTV safe margins in the X, Y, and Z axes of vacuum bag group were 6.1 mm, 9.3 mm and 5.4 mm, respectively. Conclusions: There was no significant difference of positioning reproducibility between α-cradle and vacuum bag. For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the PTV safe margins in the X, Y, and Z axes were 7 mm, 10 mm and 7 mm, respectively.'},\n",

A 95 years old female patient suffered from erythema, crusting, and increased maceration over the vulvar area for more than two years. A nodule about 1 cm in diameter had also been noted at the time she visited the dermatology department at our hospital. The biopsy showed the tumor cells are positive for CK7, which is supportive for Paget’s disease. In consideration of her old age and poor family support, surgical resection is not feasible. She was referred to the radiation oncology department for radiotherapy. The initial treatment plan was to irradiate the focal region plus 2 cm margin with 6MeV electron to a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. However, the treatment was early terminated at 20 Gy due to painful grade III dermatitis. In search of appropriate alternative treatment, 5% imiquimod cream was chosen due to its relatively mild possible adverse effects. The cream was applied on the lesions and up to 2 cm outside their visible margins every other day. After three weeks of topical cream treatment, at least partial response had been observed.

Materials and Methods : From October 2014 to December 2015, a total of 61 head and neck cancer patients who had received CCRT were enrolled. All patients received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with 60-70 Gy in 6 to 7 weeks to the target region. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of either tri-weekly cisplatin 100 mg/m^2 (P100 Q3W, n= 31) or weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m^2 (P30 QW, n= 30). The primary endpoint was acute toxicity during CCRT. The secondary endpoints were the accumulative cisplatin dose, cisplatin dose intensity, and overall treatment period of radiotherapy. Results : The baseline patient characteristics of both studies were similar between both arms. Patients who received P100 Q3W group had a higher rate of Gr 3/4 leucopenia (25.8% vs. 3.3%, p= 0.014) than those who received P30 QW. Other Gr 3/4 toxicities were similar in both arms, including neutropenia (16.1% vs. 3.3%, p= 0.095), anemia (0% vs. 3.3%, p= 0.311), thrombocytopenia (0% vs. 0%, p= 1.000), mucositis (35.5% vs. 23.3%, p= 0.300) and skin reaction (0% vs. 10.0%, p= 0.073).

The secondary aim was to assess the relationship between patient-related factors and setup errors. Materials & Methods: A prospective study with a total of 17 post-operative breast cancer patients was conducted between July 2013 and May 2016. All patients received two kinds of image-guided methods, EPI and 4D-CBCT, before each treatment in the first ten fractions of radiation. The translations in left-right (LR), superior-inferior (SI) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions under different image-guided techniques were measured by physicians on-line. Group systematic (Σ) and random errors (σ) for each axis of EPI and 4D-CBCT were calculated. The optimal PTV margins were computed based on van Herk's formula. Differences in daily positioning errors were examined using Wilcoxon singed-ranks test to compare the results between EPI and 4D-CBCT. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to distinguish the significance between the setup errors and the following patient-related factors: age, height, weight, BMI, laterality of breast cancer and the chest ratio of maximal anterior-posterior to lateral diameter measured from simulation images. Results: The total serial images were 170 EPIs and 170 4D-CBCTs.

In the SI direction, the systemic setup errors were significantly different between EPI vs. 4D-CBCT (1.40 mm vs. 1.78 mm; p= 0.005). The calculated PTV margins (mm) measured by EPI and 4D-CBCT were 2.63 and 3.85 in LR direction; 6.09 and 6.68 in SI direction; 3.85 and 4.34 in AP direction, respectively. None of the patient-related factors have conclusive influence on these setup errors. Conclusion : This study found that EPI would significantly underestimate the setup errors in the SI direction compared to 4D-CBCT, which in-turn generates a narrower PTV margin by van Herk's formula. Thus we should be careful when using EPI for correction of inter-fraction setup errors in the SI direction of breast cancer patients. We suggest applying the optimal PTV margins calculated from the 4D-CBCT method for clinical application.\"},\n",

Data of BMI and waist circumference for each patient were collected. Images from free breathing CT scans and MIP images from 4D-CT scans were obtained for each patient and used for delineating CTV_(NB) and CTV_(MIP), respectively. We calculated the percentage of volume difference (V_(diff)) between CTV_(NB) and CTV_(MIP). Linear regression analysis between V_(diff) and BMI, and V_(diff) and waist circumference were performed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) . Results : For patients with pulmonary tumor, there was no correlation between V_(diff) and BMI, and between V_(diff) and waist circumference. For patients with hepatic tumor, our study showed a significant correlation between V_(diff) and BMI, but no correlation between V_(diff) and waist circumference. According to the correlation analysis in our study, BMI was a factor influencing the magnitude of respiration-induced hepatic tumor motion. Conclusion : Our study showed that there was a significant correlation between V_(diff) and BMI for patients with hepatic tumor. We speculate that the small V_(diff) for patients with hepatic tumor and high BMI was caused by the tumor location which near the diaphragm, and the magnitude of diaphragm motion was easily influenced by the BMI. Therefore, we could design appropriate treatment techniques for breathing control according to the BMI of the patient.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose : Helical tomotherapy (HT) is a intensity-modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) delivery system that achieves high dose conformality by multileaf collimator motion during treatment. The goal of this study was to evaluate the plan quality and delivery accuracy of the Hi-Art system with different plan parameters for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Materials and Methods: A total of 10 cases were analyzed in this study. Three HT treatments plans were generated for each case in the setting of without block, directional block and complete block respectively to adequately treat the planning target volume and spare the organ at risk. Patient delivery quality assurance (DQA) is an essential task to ensure the accuracy of doses delivered to the patients. The absolute point dose was measured with an Exradin A1SL ion chamber and Tomoelectrometer (Standard Imaging, Middleton, WI) which can be positioned anywhere along the central axis of the phantom, and Gafchromic EBT3 films were placed in the coronal orientation to acquire the planar representations of dose distribution. The measurements were analyzed using the gamma evaluation with the 3% dose and 3 mm distance criteria. Results: The results demonstrate that without block was capable of providing more uniform target doses. The conformation number and homogeneity index of plans without block were better than directional block and complete block. The average MUs was 3338.1, 3871.7, 4761.4 MU, and the delivery times was 237.3, 273.6, 334.3 seconds respectively. The V_5 values for the normal liver was 81.8%, 71.8%, 57.5%. All of the cases passed the 3% point dose difference criteria. The 3% / 3 mm average gamma passing rate was 96.7 ± 2.2%, 95.8 ± 2.8%, 94.6 ± 3.8% for without block, directional block and complete block respectively. Conclusions: The results of this study had demonstrated that the three types of plans can be delivered accurately based on their own QA standards. The major advantage of directional block is to reduce the low dose region of normal liver and just increased approximately 15% of delivery time. The directional block can provide a good choice to the HCC patients with chronic hepatitis.'},\n",

Due to the rarity of GS, the optimal therapy is not well defined, and the clinical therapies for GS are usually in accordance with glioblastoma guidelines by the mode of maximal surgical resection followed by chemo-radiotherapy with temozolomide. This report describes three rare pathologically confirmed cases of GS in our hospital and analyzes the distinct clinical features, treatment course with more focus on radiotherapy, and their outcome. In our three GS patients, two males and one female with a median age of 61, the main tumors all occurred in the supra-tentorial brain. Two cases are presented with CNS metastasis to different cerebral lobes, and one case with widespread leptomeninges at initial diagnosis. Extra-cranial metastasis is also exhibited in the lungs and pleura during the clinical course. All patients received postoperative radiation therapy with conventional fractionation or hypofractionation regimen. The total radiation dose to the involved brain tumor bed (planning target volume) reached 50 - 60 Gy (range 50.4 to 59.4 Gy). Our results support the role of local radiotherapy after surgery, and the local control effect can be achieved or palliated without obvious side effects.

Materials and Methods : Between March 2009 and October 2014, 22 patients with classical TN, refractory to previous medical or surgical treatments, received treatment at our CyberKnife center. The prescription dose of CKRS (range: 60-65 Gy) was delivered to the involved trigeminal nerve root entry zone with a 3-mm gap from the brainstem. Radiation dose to the brainstem was limited to 50% of the maximum dose or no more than 40 Gy. Treatment outcomes were assessed through telephone inquiries and scheduled follow-up visits. Treatment responses were addressed in a standard questionnaire containing the Barrow Neurologic Institute (BNI) pain score and facial numbness score. Results : The median duration of follow-up was 36 months. All patients responded to CKRS, as demonstrated by an improvement in their BNI pain scores. Median time to initial onset of pain relief was 7 days, and to maximal pain relief was 2 months. At the last follow-up, 13 patients (59%) were free from any pain (BNI I); 3 patients (14%) had occasional pain and no need of medication (BNI II), and 6 patients (27%) had moderate pain which was adequately controlled with medications (BNI III).

       "  'e': 'Purpose : Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare mesenchymal tumor, encompassing tumor previously termed hemangiopericytoma (HPC). The aim of this study is to evaluate both histopathological and clinical factors of intracranial SFT, including tumors previously classified as HPC, and offer an analysis of treatment outcomes based on our experience. Materials & Methods : Between 2002 and 2016, 18 patients with intracranial SFT receiving radiotherapy at our hospital were eligible for this study. Hemangiopericytoma was grouped with grade II SFT, and anaplastic hemangiopericytoma was grouped with grade III SFT since they share similar genetic patterns and clinical prognosis. Clinicopathological and radiotherapy data were extracted from patient’s medical record. Radiotherapy was administered by either conventional fractionated radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery. The planning system includes Varian Medical System and BrainLab system. Results : Reviewing operative records, gross total resection was performed in 14 (77.8%) cases, while the remaining 4 (22.2%) cases had subtotal resection. All patients underwent postoperative RT. Before radiation therapy at our department, ten patients received one operation for SFT, four patients received two operations and the other four patients received more than two operations. Twelve patients received conventional fractionated radiotherapy and 6 received stereotactic radiosurgery. The median dose is 55.5 Gy (range 30 － 60 Gy) for fractionated RT and 16 Gy (range 15 － 16 Gy) for SRS. The median target volume for patients who received fractionated radiotherapy was 123.8 cm^3 (49.1 － 237.0 cm^3) and 5.84 cm^3 (range 3.5 － 29.24 cm^3) for those who received stereotactic radiosurgery. Median follow-up time was 73.6 months. Five and 10 years overall survival rates were 70.5%, and 47.0%, respectively. Tumors reoccurred as intracranial recurrence only (n= 3), and extracranial metastasis alone (n= 4). Local control rate at 5 years was 90.9%. The 5-year metastasis-free rate was 100.0% for grade II (n= 9) tumors and 40.0% for grade III tumors (n= 9) (p= 0.02). There was a trend toward improved progression-free rate in low-grade tumors, with a 5-year progression-free rate of 83.3% for grade II, and 34.3% for grade III tumors (p= 0.09). There was no significant difference for overall survival, progression free rate or local control rates by extent of surgery in this study. Conclusion : For patients with intracranial SFTs, resection remains the initial treatment and postoperative radiotherapy provides an effective and safe adjuvant management option. Histological grading is the most significant prognostic factor.'},\n",

The purpose of this study is to review the outcomes and toxicities of adjuvant radiotherapy for advanced stage upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) of the renal pelvis or ureter in our single institution. Materials and Methods : We collected the patients with the diagnosis of UTUC of the renal pelvis or ureter, who received nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff resection (NUR+BCR) and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in our institution from 2006 to 2015. Clinicopathologic features, treatment modalities, toxicities and outcome variables were retrospectively reviewed. Adjuvant RT was given with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) technique for all the patients. Systemic chemotherapy (C/T) was administered at the physician’s discretion of medical oncologists. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant-metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and bladder-recurrence-free survival (BRFS). A subgroup analysis of treatment toxicities and failure pattern between the RT-alone group and C/T-combined group were also performed. Results : Twenty patients were eligible for the final analysis. All the patients received curative surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy with IMRT technique. Median dose of RT was 50.4 Gy (range 45.0 to 64.8 Gy). Median follow-up time was 2.67 years. The estimated 3-year OS, LRFS, DMFS and BRFS were 65.8%, 81.5%, 73.3% and 92.3%. We found that the patients with positive or close surgical margins had inferior overall survival (p= .001). No significant difference could be demonstrated in survival outcome between the groups with or without C/T administration. None of the patients experienced grade 3 or higher acute toxicities in our study. Conclusions : Adjuvant radiotherapy with IMRT technique after curative surgery for advanced stage UTUC patients achieved a comparable outcome with acceptable patient compliance and adverse events in our institution. The benefit of chemotherapy needs further elucidation through novel prospective studies.'},\n",

       "  'e': \"Purpose : Effective management of patient data, timely completion of records, and patient scheduling issues are important but tedious tasks. We developed and implemented a web-based oncology information system to facilitate management of patient records and task scheduling. Material and Methods: We developed a web-based interface and underlying database aimed to facilitate capture of patient-related information. This system dynamically presents patients currently on-treatment and patients on the waiting list, and also keeps track of due medical records. Integration with imaging, lab, and electronic medical record systems allows rapid physician access to relevant data. Scheduling capability was also implemented. Results : Since implementation of the system in September 2007, the database now contains over 15,000 entries. This system can be used anywhere in the hospital with Intranet access. Data is displayed according to defined privileges: physicians can easily access patient medical data, while departmental staff handles scheduling at ease. Department-wide patient demographics, patient throughput, and machine usage statistics generated by this system provides invaluable insight to aid management. Recently, several new features, including integration with Cancer Center subsystems and the ability to review residents' notes have been added to meet user needs. Conclusions: We implemented a web-based system tailored to radiation oncology workflow. This system allows physicians to keep track of patient status and provides administrative insight. The ability to progressively incorporate new functions is a highlight feature of our system.\"},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose : The Varian TrueBeam system is a modern radiotherapy unit. Undesired neutrons are produced by the interaction of high-energy (＞10 MV) photons with high-Z components such as the flattening filter (FF) and jaws. The new design of the Varian TrueBeam system enables the linac to be operated in the flattening-filter-free (FFF) mode, as well as in the FF mode. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the neutron ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), around the TrueBeam linac in the FF and FFF modes by using a wide energy neutron detection instrument (WENDI-II). Materials and Methods : Ten-megavolt X-ray beams were used in the FF and FFF modes, with the jaws and multileaf collimators fully closed. The dose delivery rates were set to 600 MU/min in the FF mode and 2400 MU/min in the FFF mode. The H*(10) was measured using the WENDI-II located at the isocenter, 50 and 100 cm away from the isocenter, and at the entrance and exit of the maze. The dose delivery was set to 200 MU. Result : The H*(10) was proportional to the monitor unit and declined with increasing distance to the isocenter. The distribution of scattered neutrons did not appear to be isotropic; the H*(10) was somewhat higher in the gun-target direction. The neutron ambient dose equivalent in the FFF mode was 30.8 μSv, lower than the 92.5 μSv detected in the FF mode. In the FFF mode, the neutron ambient dose equivalent in the maze decreased to 6.71 μSv. Conclusion : Operating the TrueBeam system in the FFF mode greatly decreases the level of undesired neutrons. It also corresponds to a reduction in activation within the treatment vault and subsequent exposure to patients and radiotherapists.'},\n",

About 80% of pancreatic EMPs are located in the head of the pancreas, whilst the remaining 20% are found in the body and/or the tail of the organ. The computed tomography (CT) appearance of pancreatic EMP is typically described as a multilobular solid hypodense mass with homogeneous intravenous contrast enhancement. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-fine needle aspiration (FNA) has been proven as the most effective means for making a definitive cytological diagnosis of a pancreatic mass. To date, a standardized treatment for EMPs of the pancreas has not been established. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and bypass procedures either alone or in combination have been described. Owing to the highly radiosensitive nature of plasma cell tumors, radiotherapy has been suggested as the treatment of choice. There is scarce information about results of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the treatment of EMP of the pancreas. IMRT can deliver adequate target coverage while minimizing the dose to critical organs. We report a case of EMP of the pancreas treated with IMRT.

The grading of toxicity was evaluated using CTCAE version 3.0. Result: The median follow-up was 12.1 months. The median overall survival among all patients was 15 months. The treatment outcomes between tomotherapy and step-and-shoot IMRT revealed median OS time 15 months vs. 13.4 months；1 year、2 year OS rates were 69% vs. 60.6%、29.8% vs. 26.7% (p = 0.48)；1 year、2 year DFS rates were 38.4% vs. 29.2%、21.3% vs. 16.7% (p = 0.63)；1 year、2 year LC rates were 49.3% vs. 48.7%、32.9% vs. 39.0% (p = 0.75)；1 year、2 year DMFS rates were 76.5% vs. 61.4%、68.8% vs. 39.8% (p = 0.046). No significant differences in OS, DFS, and LC rates were found between tomotherapy and IMRT. There was no significant difference in LC rate with higher radiation dose (＞ 50 Gy vs. ≦50 Gy). The patients using tomotherapy had less incidence of radiation pneumonitis (2.9%) than IMRT (21.2%；p = 0.027), and favorable dose distribution to lung with V20：21.9% vs. 25.7% (p = 0.03), and mean lung dose 14.8 Gy vs. 15.3 Gy (p = 0.47) compared with IMRT. There was also better dose distribution to heart in tomotherapy which V30 was 27.8% vs. 39.6% (p = 0.02), and mean heart dose was 22 Gy vs. 26.3 Gy (p = 0.096). Conclusion: In our retrospective analysis at single institution, CCRT using tomotherapy for esophageal cancer could reduce dose to normal organs including lung and heart, and reduce incidence of radiation pneumonitis when compared with step-and-shoot IMRT. The treatment outcomes in OS, DFS, and LC rates were similar.'},\n",

In this study, we compared the treatment efficacy of tangential field-in-field (FIF), IMRT and tomotherapy for bilateral breast cancer. We analyzed the bilateral whole-breast dose coverage, conformity and homogeneity indices, and dose-volume constraints of normal tissues (the right and left lungs and heart). Results: Tomotherapy was more efficient than IMRT and FIF, exhibiting significant improvements in reducing the volume of normal tissues (heart mean doses: tomotherapy = 3.67 Gy, IMRT = 4.51 Gy and FIF = 4.84 Gy; p ＜ 0.05). Moreover, tomotherapy required a lower mean lung dose (right lung mean dose = 6.44, 9.08 and 10.03 Gy for tomotherapy, IMRT and FIF, respectively; p ＜ 0.05; left lung mean dose = 6.33, 7.85 and 8.64 Gy for tomotherapy, IMRT and FIF, respectively; p = 0.0002).

MLC systematic errors were simulated for error magnitudes of ±0.5 mm, ±1 mm, ±2 mm, and ±3 mm in X1 bank (+ open, - close). The 3 mm/3% and 2 mm/2% gamma index analysis and PTVs and OARs equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were used to evaluate the impact of MLC systematic errors on the dose distribution and the biological dose parameter. Materials and Methods: In total 97 patients with breast cancer were included, they were treated with hybrid intensity-modulated radiotherapy (Hybrid IMRT) for 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Patients were evaluated at three months after treatment through the observation of the change of chest computed tomography image. The final endpoint of complication was according to Arriagada's classification. Patients with grade 1+ change on CT images were defined as a complication of radiation pneumonitis. We evaluated the correlation of radiation pneumonitis and mean ipsilateral lung dose. We established LKB NTCP model through calculated the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) of ipsilateral lung and validated the model performance. The NTCP model was mainly used to investigate the dose-response curve for complications of radiation pneumonitis and provided dose parameters to prevent complication of endemic breast cancer patients.

       "  'e': 'Background : The benefits of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer after D2 lymph node dissection remain debatable. This study investigated the treatment outcome in patients with stage II-III gastric cancer receiving curative resection plus adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method : Between January 2006 and December 2013, 71 patients who underwent radiotherapy with a diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma were registered. Tumors were staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria (AJCC) version 7.0. Forty patients who had stage II and III disease undergoing curative resection were included in this analysis. Of them, 38 patients (95%) received D2 lymph node dissection. The RT field included tumor bed, remnant stomach, and regional lymph nodes with a standard prescribed dose of 45 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, or fluorouracil plus leucovorin. The study endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), both of which were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method. The log-rank test and Cox regression analysis were performed to examine the effects of explanatory variables on OS and PFS. Result : 30 patients died in the median follow-up duration of 22.8 months (range, 3.2 ~ 76.5), Thirty-four (80%) experienced recurrent disease (distant metastasis in 29, local relapse in 11, regional recurrence in 10). Twenty-four patients had grade 2 or above acute gastrointestinal or hematological toxicities. Three patients (8%) died from neutropenic infection during the adjuvant CRT. Multivariate analyses showed pathological T4b stage [P = .02, HR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.16–5.46] and pathological N3b stage [P = .008, HR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.28–5.32] were the independent prognostic factors for OS and PFS, respectively. Conclusion : In stage II-III gastric cancer patients receiving adjuvant CRT, treatmentrelated toxicities were the major concerns. Pathological T4b was the independent prognostic factor for OS, whereas N3b for PFS. A multi-institutional trial is recommended to optimize the treatment strategy and patient selection.'},\n",

While stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has emerged as a treatment option for HCC, there are limited data on treatment outcomes and associated prognostic factors focusing on PVTT patients. Methods and Materials : Between 2008 and 2013, 42 HCC patients with PVTT underwent SABR using a Cyberknife radiosurgery system in our institute. The mean radiation dose was 42.5 Gy, 5–12.5 Gy per fraction. We collected clinical and treatment-related factors including age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, α-fetoprotein (AFP) level, Child-Pugh score, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score, presence of extrahepatic metastasis (EM), and equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). The patients were assessed for radiographic response and survival outcome. Image response was evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier test. Prognostic factors were evaluated using a Cox regression model. Results : At the last follow up, 38 patients had died. The median survival was 8.6 months, with 1-year and 2-year OS rates of 31.4% and 14.1%, respectively. Nine patients died before imaging studies for response evaluation could be performed. In those who had radiographic response evaluation, 3% had a complete response, 55% a partial response, 39% stable disease, and 3% disease progression. Nine (21%) patients had portal vein re-canalization and then received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). In univariate analysis, Child-Pugh A (vs. B & C, HR = 0.470, p = 0.049), CLIP score ≤ 3 (vs. ＞ 3, HR = 0.468, p = 0.046), and absence of EM (vs. presence of EM, HR = 0.497, p = 0.035) were associated with a higher OS rate. Multivariate analysis showed that only an absence of EM (vs. presence of EM, HR = 0.340, p = 0.015) was a significant prognostic indicator. Conclusions : SABR is an option for HCC patients with PVTT. Absence of EM is the only independent prognostic factor for better OS. A future large-scale study to identify strict patient selection criterion may maximize the benefits of SABR.'},\n",

Materials and Methods : In total 97 patients with breast cancer were included, they were treated with hybrid intensity-modulated radiotherapy (Hybrid IMRT) for 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Patients were evaluated at three months after treatment through the observation of the change of chest computed tomography image. The final endpoint of complication was according to Arriagada’s classification. Patients with grade 1+ change on CT images were defined as a complication of radiation pneumonitis. We evaluated the correlation of radiation pneumonitis and mean ipsilateral lung dose. We established LKB NTCP model through calculated the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) of ipsilateral lung and validated the model performance. The NTCP model was mainly used to investigate the dose-response curve for complications of radiation pneumonitis and provided dose parameters to prevent complication of endemic breast cancer patients. Result : Radiation pneumonitis was significantly correlated with mean ipsilateral lung dose. The fitted LKB NTCP parameters were: TD50 = 21.26 Gy (95% CI, 19.78 - 22.97), m = 0.32 (95% CI, 0.19 - 0.81). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the NTCP model was 0.65. The model was passing through model performance validations, including Brier score, Hosmer- Lemeshow test and the calibration curve. Conclusion : We established Lyman Kutcher Burman normal tissue complication probability model for breast cancer radiation pneumonitis in this study, and defined the correlated parameters for endemic patients. We can apply these parameters to breast cancer radiation treatment planning evaluation, avoid radiation pneumonitis, and improve the patients’ quality of life after radiotherapy.'},\n",

Methods and Materials : Ten patients with huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the right liver lobe treated with Cyberknife SBRT were enrolled in this study. The dosimetric values for 3D-CRT, IMRT and Cyberknife were calculated for total doses of 40 Gy / 5 fx. Treatments were individualized on the basis of the effective liver volume irradiated maintaining ≤ 5 % risk of radiation-induced liver disease (V15 Gy to ≤ 700 ml normal liver volume). Other parameters included the conformal index (CI), homogeneity index (HI) and hot spot (Dmax) for the planning target volume (PTV). Results : The GTV was covered adequately by all techniques PTV coverage of Cyberknife was comparable to 3D-CRT and IMRT (p= 0.0544); CI of IMRT were significantly lower than 3D-CRT and Cyberknife (p=0.0082). While HI and Dmax were significantly lower with 3D-CRT than with IMRT and Cyberknife (p= 0.0001). Conclusions : SBRT with Cyberknife provided an option for huge HCC in the right lobe although tumor coverage compared with 3D-CRT or IMRT was of borderline significance. IMRT and 3D-CRT resulted in a more conformal and homogenous plan than Cyberknife. And in terms of organ sparing, 3D-CRT was the most effective in the sparing of non-liver organs. However, Cyberknife had the advantage for accurate target localization by real time tracking as compared with other SBRT modalities and eliminated the discomfort of abdominal compression or respiratory control used in other SBRT techniques.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose : The study aims to optimize the initial parameters and calculating efficiency in Monte Carlo simulation for Cyberknife G3 system. Materials and Methods : BEAM09 Monte Carlo codes were applied in this study. The BEAMnrc code was used to simulate the treatment head and generate the phase space files. The DOSXYZnrc code was used to calculate the depth dose curves (percentage depth dose, PDD), lateral profiles and the output factors. Mean energy and the FWHMR were used to determine initial electron parameters. For calculating dose in the region of interest, the use of smaller voxel size may increase the calculation time; conversely, the adaption of larger voxel size may cause a higher partial volume effect. This study aims to investigate the optimal voxel size for dose calculation in a water phantom to achieve reasonable simulation efficiency and an acceptable accuracy. The Kα method was used for the optimization by comparing the differences between diode measurement data and MC simulations in PDDs and profiles. Disagreement between simulation and measurement were evaluated through the dose differences of PDDs from depths of 1.5 to 20 cm, and the lateral profiles of 80% field width. Distance to agreement (DTA) at lateral positions of 20% to 80% dose profiles of penumbra region were also used for the comparisons. Result : For the efficiency of dose calculation, setting the voxel size equal to one tenth of field width would produce optimal simulation efficiency and acceptable accuracy. According to these parameters, the dose differences of the PDDs were about 1% from depths of 1.5 to 20 cm, the dose differences for lateral profiles within 80% field width were also within 1.5%, and the disagreements of DTA were less than 0.5 mm. The discrepancies of output factor were from 2.8 to 5% for the three smallest cones, which were possibly caused by the effect of electron scattering at the metallic parts of the detector shielding. Conclusion : For Monte Carlo simulations of LINAC and dose calculations, it is important to accurately determine the initial electron beam. These parameters, mean energy and FWHM of incidence electron, have been determined by matching the calculated dose with the measured dose through a trial and error process. This study also applied some methods to increase simulation efficiency which could be the reference of future research.'},\n",

The incidence of elevated serum levels of AFP in pancreatic carcinomas has been reported to be 2.1%–24.0%. Most of the AFP-producing pancreatic cancers are pancreatoblastomas occurring in children or acinar cell carcinomas. The mean age of AFP-producing pancreatic cancers was among 50 years old.

EPF with purulent pericarditis is an acute and fulminant disease that has high mortality rate if delayed diagnosed and treated. Because some of the symptoms of EPF formation mimic those discomfort arising from esophageal cancer and chemoradiotherapy, it will go unnoticed unless a high index of suspicion has been placed. In the case of the lower third thoracic esophageal tumor and anterior wall close to the pericardium, we should maintain a high index of suspicion of this life-threatening complication during and after chemoradiotherapy.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Background : This study evaluated cranial nerve (CN) involvement and the outcomes of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Method : This study recruited 230 patients with histologically proven NPC without metastasis who were treated with IMRT at our institution between 2007 and 2013. Twenty-two patients had CN involvement. The primary tumor and involved lymph nodes were prescribed 69.96-70 Gy, the microscopic areas were prescribed 59.4-63 Gy, and clinically negative neck regions were prescribed 54.45-56 Gy in 33–35 fractions. Twenty-one patients with CN involvement received RT combined with chemotherapy. Result : The incidence of CN involvement was 9.6%. The most commonly involved CNs were the trigeminal (59.1%) and abducens nerves (45.5%), with the most commonly presenting symptoms being neuroophthalmic manifestations (68.2%), followed by facial numbness or pain (45.5%). The 3-year overall survival (OS), local relapse-free survival (LRFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 79.2%, 82.9%, and 50.0% respectively. Significant differences were observed in the 3-year OS rate (100% vs 43.7%, p = 0.016) and DFS (77.8% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.014) between patients with pretreatment neurological symptoms that presented for less than 3 months and more than 3 months. Patients with complete recovery of neurological symptoms after treatment tended to exhibit higher 3-year DFS (100% vs. 30.0%, p = 0.071). Single or multiple CN involvement and clinically or radiologically diagnosed CN involvement were not prognosticators for NPC patients with CN involvement. No temporal lobe necrosis was noted as the late effect. Conclusion : The pretreatment duration of neurological symptoms is a significant prognostic factor for the OS and DFS of NPC patients with CN palsy. Patients with a complete neurological response after treatment tend to exhibit higher DFS (p = 0.071). However, the outcome of NPC patients with CN palsy is not affected by the extensive involvement of CN lesions or the mode of diagnosis, either clinical or radiological.'},\n",

Materials & Methods : From August 2013 to August 2015, 11 patients with cervical esophageal SCC scheduled to receive preoperative CCRT with surgery were retrospectively analyzed. The gross tumor and involved lymphadenopathies were delivered with 48 Gy and 43.2 Gy to subclinical mucosal/submucosal disease and regional lymphatic basin in 24 fractions by simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) planning through intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or Tomotherapy. Chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m^2 was administered during radiation therapy (RT) course. Side effects grading was according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). The image assessment and pathological responses were recorded and graded. Results : Among all 11 patients, ten of them had received the planned CCRT completely and one was dead due to aspiration pneumonia and sepsis during CCRT course. Of the 10 patients who completed preoperative CCRT, 8 patients of them have received esophagectomy. The pathological T down-staging was noted in 4 patients (50%) and pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 1 patient (12.5%). Seven of these 8 patients (87.5%) preserved the larynx and 6 patients (75%) achieved negative surgical margins (R0 resection). The most severe acute toxicities from CCRT were grade 3 cough (n=1, 10%) and grade 3 anemia (n=1, 10%). According to chest surgeons’ consensus, the cut-off point for larynx-preserving surgery after CCRT for cervical esophageal cancer could be 2-cm distance from esophageal tumor to larynx. Conclusion : Preoperative CCRT followed by larynx-sparing surgery is feasible in cervical esophageal SCC.

       "  'e': 'Purpose : In recent years, computed tomography scanners are widely used in the gel dosimeter for reading of the image information. However, the scanning parameter settings of computed tomography scanners will affect the image noise, thereby affecting the dose resolution. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the optimal scanning parameters of the CT scanner as the reading tool applied in NIPAM gel dosimeter to reduce the gel image noise, improve signal to noise ratio and increase availability of gel dosimeter in the clinical. Materials and Methods : Computer tomography scanner was applied to capture image in the gel dosimeter. Different scanning parameters were used to capture gel images. Scanning parameters changed independently from each other in order to evaluate the image noise affected by each individual parameter. Result : When the tube current was increased, the image noise would reduce. If the tube voltage was 80 kVp, 120 kVp, 140 kVp, and tube current increased from 100 mA to 230 mA, it can reduce the image noise to 59.3%, 64.1% and 60.7 %, respectively. In the same case, smaller image noise was obtained in the higher tube voltage. If the tube voltage was increased from 80 kVp to 140 kVp with 5 mm slice thickness, the noise can be reduced 52.4%. When the slice thickness was changed to 10 mm, the noise can be reduced 55.0%. Conclusion and Discussion : While the computer tomography scanner was used in the gel dosimeter for reading of the image information, the scanning parameters settings were needed to compromise for balancing and optimizing between tube head loading and the decreasing of the image noise. The tube voltage of 120 kVp and tube current of 200 mA are recommended for the optimizing settings by this study but the slice thickness is selected according to different conditions. Optimizing scanning parameter settings can reduce image noise affecting the interference resolution of the gel dosimeter in order to increase the accuracy of gel dosimeter in the clinical dose assessment.'},\n",

The patient survived for more than 48 months since the initial diagnosis and is still alive at the time of manuscript preparation. As intensity modulated radiation therapy is becoming widely accessible in Taiwan, there is an unmet need to document outcome and side effect profiles from aggressive CCRT to primary and recurrent cardiac malignancy.'},\n",

Materials & Methods: From 2011 to 2015, we retrospectively reviewed 59 patients who underwent at least five sessions of definitive or adjuvant radiotherapy with CBCT. All the images were obtained prior to treatment. All the setup corrections were determined by physicians. The definitions of axis was X in left-right, Y in superior-inferior and Z in anterior-posterior. The overall mean error, systemic error (Σ) and random error (σ) were calculated for each axis. We used ANOVA and Student t-test models to evaluate the significance among various clinical factors and the setup errors.

When other treatment modalities have been exhausted, repeat irradiation may be the only option. A single institution experience of repeat irradiation of hepatocellular carcinoma is reported here. Materials and Methods: Between 2003 and 2013, 19 patients (M/F = 17/2; median age = 64.4 years) with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (8 in-field and 11 out-field) and having had previous radiotherapy, were treated with repeat irradiation. The primary eligibility criteria for selecting these patients for repeat liver irradiation was normal liver volume greater than 700 mL. The median equivalent dose in 2 Gy (EQD2) delivered to tumors was 47.5 Gy (range: 30-71 Gy). A proportion of patients had concurrent and maintenance angiogenic blockades. Univariate analyses were used to identify statistically significant prognostic factors. Results: Among the 19 patients, complete response was achieved in 4 patients, and partial response in 6.

The presence of either longer treatment intervals between radiotherapies (＞ 6.2 months) or use of angiogenic blockades was associated with longer overall survival on univariate analysis. The incidence of radiation induced liver injury was 11%. Conclusions: Repeat hepatic irradiation is possible where the necessary dosimetric parameters can be met. Patients with longer intervals between radiotherapies may achieve longer survival rates in comparison to those without. Survival benefit is attainable with concomitant and maintenance angiogenic blockades.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose : This study aims at developing an immune-biosensor that can detect carcinoembryonic antigens (CEAs) in real time. Malignant tumors were the top cause of death in Taiwan in 2014. Among the GI tract cancer deaths, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and esophageal cancer ranked third, seventh, and ninth. CEAs are the tumor biomarkers used when screening for human GI tract cancers. At present, immunoassays are the most widely used screening method. However, they are extremely time-consuming and require approximately 2-3 h per test. Thus, the present study is aimed at developing an immune-biosensor that can perform real-time CEA detection. Materials and Methods : Biosensor analysis technologies are fast becoming the preferred technology for analysis and screening in the 21st century. Such technologies operate by combining biometric materials, such as antibodies and enzymes, and various signal converters, such as microbalances or electrochemical electrodes. In the present study, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), with advantages of high stability, high sensitivity, real-time output, and reusability, was coated with polypropylene and equipped with a self-developed auto-sampling device to create a novel polypropylene-coated quartz crystal microbalance with auto-sampling (pQCM). The pQCM was then combined with CEA-related antibodies (high specificity and affinity to CEAs) to develop an immuno-biosensor that can instantaneously measure CEA concentrations, thereby creating an effective means to instantly screen for gastrointestinal cancers. Result : CEA-related monoclonal antibodies were adhered to the surface of the pQCM to create a CEA sensor. Four standard sample solutions were prepared by dissolving 0.2, 2.5, 25, and 200 ng/ml of CEA into phosphate buffered saline solution. The CEA sensor was then used to test the standard sample solutions. The samples with the lowest (0.5 ng/ml) and highest (200 ng/ml) CEA concentrations required only 5 and 10 min to complete testing, respectively. Tests were repeated 16 times over 8 days. Results indicated that the relative vibration frequency shift was maintained at 95% or higher, suggesting that the results achieved excellent operational stability. For comparison, samples prepared with 25 ng/ml of ferritin and α-fetoprotein only achieved a responsiveness of 3.9% and 4.6%, respectively. Subsequently, the test results of the 25 ng/ml CEA samples separately prepared with the 25 ng/ml of ferritin and α-fetoprotein showed an increase in responsiveness of only 6.5% compared to those of the pure 25 ng/ml CEA sample, confirming the excellent specificity of the proposed biosensor. Discussion : The proposed CEA sensor satisfies the requirements of the present study; in addition, the systems technology established in the present study can be applied to developing biosensors for multiple cancer biomarkers or even a cumulative and multifunctional cancer screening system, greatly benefiting the early identification of cancer.'},\n",

According to Report No. 142 of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, we developed daily quality assurance for a two-dimensional image-guided system. This study reports our results and benefit analysis. Materials and Methods : Our image-guided linear accelerator was Varian Trilogy with On-Board Imager (OBI) system. The QA phantom was Isocenter Cube Assay (Varian TM55150000 isocenter Cube tool). A qualified radiation technologist executed 40 daily QAs for our two-dimensional image-guided system. QA items included collision interlocks, imaging and treatment coordinate coincidence and positioning tests. To ensure the correct position of the treatment couch, we performed three QA methods. First, we interpreted the displacement on a graph paper visually. Second, we identified the displacement of Ball Bullet (BB) on the center of the image-guided system by using orthogonal films (BB image analysis and detection). Third, we calculated the difference between BB and the intersection of laser lines (visual inspection of BB). We compared these three QA methods, including the time cost. Result : All collision interlocks tests had positive results. All imaging and treatment coordinates and positioning test results were within the range of allowable errors. Comparing the first two methods of position testing, no statistically significant difference was detected between them (P values in X-Y-Z three axes and total error, 0.229, 1, 0.867 and 0.196, respectively). Comparing the mean time taken for couch positioning among the three QA methods, the BB image analysis and detection took 0.4 seconds longer than the visual inspection of graph paper. The visual inspection of graph paper took 17.6 second longer than the visual inspection of BB. There was no statistically significant difference between the visual inspection of graph paper and BB image analysis and detection (P＞ 0.05). However, statistically significant differences were detected both (1) between the visual inspection of graph paper and the visual inspection of BB (P = 0.00012), and (2) between the BB image analysis and the visual inspection of BB (P = 0.00006). Conclusion : Our QA methods ensure the quality of two-dimensional image-guided radiation therapy in both Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) and OBI systems. The QA procedures are easy to implement. To ensure the accuracy of radiotherapy, establishing QA procedures for image-guided systems is strongly recommended.'},\n",

Even in its late course, distant metastasis is still rare. Previously, once cancer patients with distant metastasis - even in limited number or small size (i.e., oligometastasis) - were considered as having an ＂incurable＂ disease. Thus, palliative treatments were recommended. However, several lines of evidence showed that while applying aggressive managements, most oligometastatic cancer patients demonstrated a durable disease-free survival when compared with those patients with disseminated metastases. This observation implicated that oligometastasis may be a 'potentially curable,' rather than ＂incurable＂ disease status. This phenomenon has been observed in several types of cancers, such as colorectal cancer, melanoma, and endometrium cancer. But, few data were reported in oral cancer. Herein, we presented an oral cancer patient with an un-resectable pulmonary oligometastasis. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) was given in conjunction with Simultaneous Integrated Inner-Escalated Boost (SIEB) technique. Four months after SABR/SIEB, complete response was observed.

       "  'e': 'Introduction : The purpose of this study is to evaluate preliminary outcomes in locally advanced rectal cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Material and Method : From 2006 to 2013, 166 patients with newly diagnosed clinical stage II or III rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant CCRT were identified (cT2- 3=155, cT4=11, cN+=93). All of them received external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with median dose of 5040 cGy (4400 - 5400 cGy). The regimens of chemotherapy combined with radiation were Capecitabine (47%), Tegafur & Uracil (40%) and others. Median duration from the end of neoadjuvant CCRT to surgery was 56 days (21 - 173 days). All radical surgery were done in a total mesorectal excision (TME) fashion. The end points of this study included overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), pelvic recurrence-free survival (PRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). We also analyzed factors associated with pathological complete response (pCR) and outcomes between different surgical procedures. Result : After a median follow-up duration of 3.03 years (0.22 - 8.16 years), 5-year OS rate was 73%, 5-year CSS rate was 78%, median PRFS was 2.6 ± 2 years, and median DMFS was 2.2 ± 2 years. There were no differences in OS (p= .776) and CSS (p= .717) between patients receiving Capecitabine or Tegafur & Uracil combined with radiation. We achieved pCR rate of 11.45%, and ratio of receiving anal-preservation surgery was 77% (59%, 87%, 100% for lower third, middle third, and upper third tumor, respectively). In subgroup analysis, laparoscopic surgery group had lower pelvic recurrence rate (11.1% v.s 25.6%, p= .036), less intra-operative blood loss (mean, 174 cc v.s 309 cc, p= .012), and shorter hospital stay (mean, 8 days v.s 13 days, p= .000). The 5-year OS rate was 78% for laparoscopic surgery group and 59% for open surgery group respectively (p = .126), the 5-year CSS rate was 80% and 72% (p= .572), median PRFS was 2.2 years and 4.6 years (p= .672), and median DMFS was 2 years and 3.5 years (p= .549). Conclusion : Neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery is a feasible way to treat locally advanced rectal cancer, and the 5-year OS rate was 73% in the current study. Capecitabine and Tegafur & Uracil are reasonable choices as concurrent regimens. Laparoscopic surgery is recommended due to lower surgical morbidities and noninferiority of outcomes.'},\n",

Our purpose is to formulate and validate a surrogate estimate for the time interval between surgery and adjuvant RT. Materials and Methods: Information of patients with malignant brain tumors diagnosed and treated with surgery and adjuvant RT between Jan. 1, 2011 and Dec. 31, 2012 was obtained from the National Health Insurance (NHI) database and retrospectively analyzed. The surrogate estimate for the interval between surgery and RT was formulated according to the date of outpatient visits and the first date of hospitalization. Surrogate estimate of the interval was validated with the exact interval calculated by the later coded dates of surgery and RT from the database, using the best-fitting linear regression. Results: 1,527 cases of malignant brain tumors were defined according to ICD-9 diagnosis code. 394 cases were excluded for the presence of other cancer diagnoses. Among the remaining 1,133 cases, 463 cases receiving both brain tumor excision and adjuvant RT were analyzed. Surrogate estimate of time intervals and exact time intervals correlate well with a slope of 1.0076, a y-intercept close to -1 day, and an R2 of 0.8633. The calculation is further improved to an R2 of 0.9809 with a slope of 0.9951 and a y-intercept close to 5 days, by excluding cases with surrogate estimates of an interval smaller or equal to 0. Conclusion: Our validated surrogate estimate of the interval between surgery and adjuvant RT provides a possible method to overcome the limitation of inadequate date information before Jan. 1, 2011, and therefore enables the application of most of the data from the Health and Welfare Database for research regarding the effect of RT delay on cancer outcomes.'},\n",

In the literature, the number of such cases is very low and the treatment outcomes are varied. Surgery remains the primary local treatment. Radiotherapy may be added to enhance local-regional control. Here, we present a 45-year-old male who underwent surgical removal of pleomorphic adenoma of the right parotid gland twice. He was eventually diagnosed with carcinosarcoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. Treatment consisted of superficial parotidectomy and adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation with weekly cisplatin and a radiation dose of 66 Gy. After 30 weeks of follow-up, no disease recurrence or distant metastasis was observed.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose : Patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) undergoing surgery were recommended to receive adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy if there are unfavorable prognostic factors. Positive surgical margin and extracapsular extension (ECE) of lymph node were well-known major prognostic factors and adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was suggested for patients with these factors. However, the managements of patients with other risk factors were still debatable. In this study, we tried to recognize the minor risk factors and provide adjuvant treatment suggestions. Materials and Methods : From January 2002 to December 2013, 567 OSCC patients receiving radical surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Five-year locoregional control (LRC), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the risk factors for LRC, DFS, and OS. Cox regression model was used for multivariate analyses. Results : The median follow-up time was 3.5 years (range: 0.2–12.5 years). The median age of the patients was 54 years old (range 28 to 79 years). The 5-year OS rate for stage I, II, III, IVa, IVb patients were 79.7%, 70.8%, 65.8%, 49.0%, and 17.7%, respectively. The 5-year DFS rate for stage I, II, III, IVa, IVb patients were 65.8%, 63.8%, 61.5%, 39.9% and 30.1%, respectively. The 5-year LRC rate for stage I, II, III, IVa, IVb patients were 77.6%, 77.6%, 76%, 67.8% and 42.5%, respectively. The pathological T-classification, pathological N-classification, ECE, pathological tumor depth, lymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, histology grading were prognostic factors for 5-year LRC, DFS and OS. Moreover, age and treatment modalities were prognostic factors for 5-year OS and age, performance status, vascular invasion and treatment modalities were prognostic factors for 5-year DFS, respectively. In subgroup analysis, 203 patients with at least two of poor prognostic factors and without positive margin nor ECE receiving RT with radiation dose at least 60 Gy showed better 5-year LRC (76.2% v.s 68.6%, p= 0.027) and DFS (56.1% v.s 44.1%, p= 0.05) and OS (63.9% v.s 50.4%, p= 0.021) than those without adjuvant RT or receiving RT with radiation dose less than 60 Gy. Conclusions : In addition to ECE and positive margin, pathological T-classification T4a/T4b, pathological positive node, pathological tumor depth ≧ 10 mm, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, perineural invasion and poorly differentiated grading were poor prognostic factors for LRC and survival outcomes for OSCC patients. Patients with two or more poor prognostic factors should receive radiotherapy with radiation dose at least 60 Gy.'},\n",

Materials and Methods : Twelve postoperative left breast cancer patients needing nodal irradiation were evaluated. Five used IDIRG technique and seven used the traditional FB method. The IDIRG method differs most from FB technique during the CT-simulation phase. Patients were asked to take interrupted deep inspiration breaths monitored by the Varian Real-time Position Management Respiratory Gating System (RPM). Axial CT was applied instead of routinely used Helical CT. Target delineation included the whole left breast, left chest wall, and regional lymph nodes with or without internal mamillary nodes. Treatment planning was made using volumetric modulated arc technique. Result : There was no statistically significant difference in IDIRG and FB in respect to target volume (855.85 ml vs 836.83 ml, p= 0.740), target coverage (97.41% vs 96.99%, p =0.728), and hotspot (113.33% vs 114.42%, p= 0.128). In terms of left pulmonary and cardiac endpoints, IDIRG showed significantly larger total lung volume (3465.33ml vs 2065.14ml, p ＜0.001) which translated into a lesser, but not statistically significant, left pulmonary dose (V20: 27.92% vs 30.11%, p= 0.156; V10: 47.42% vs 51.08%, p= 0.199), and significant reduction in cardiac dose including heart (V25: 4.77% vs 17.09%, p= 0.012; mean dose: 10.78 Gy vs 15.71 Gy, p= 0.016) and left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) (D10: 31.80 Gy vs 50.41 Gy, p= 0.004; mean dose: 24.46 Gy vs 43.64 Gy, p＜ 0.001).

       "  'e': 'Purpose : The purpose of the Rounded Leaf Offset (RLO) table was to take into account the differences between planning leaf positions and actual radiation leaf edges. Most users utilize the default RLO table supplied by the vendor. Our goal was to improve the dosimetric accuracy in Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) by applying the measured RLO parameters. Materials and Methods : This study consists of two parts: (1)The radiation leaf edges at various positions were measured with ion chamber dosimetry system. The results were compared with the default table in the Treatment Planning System (TPS). (2) Five VMAT clinical plans were used to evaluate the overall dosimetric effects of RLO table. An ion chamber in a solid water phantom was used to determine the absolute dose at a reference point for each plan. The 2D dose distributions were measured with a 2D-Array dosimetry system. Results : The RLO measurements showed that the offsets were between -0.205 mm and 0.658 mm when the leaf positions crossed the central axis of the beam. The differences between the default and measured RLO values were less than 1 mm when the leaf positions were in the range of -8 cm and 0 cm, but at -10 cm position the difference was 1.6 mm. At the central beam axis, the measured correction was 0.538 mm and the others were in range of 0.655 mm and -1.061 mm for the leaf positions at 2 cm to 18 cm. After the modification of RLO table, the TPS calculated doses for the VMAT plans were lower than those calculated with default RLO table. Also, based on the measurements of 5 VMAT plans, the point doses improved about 1.6% to 3.4%, and the 2D dose distributions using 3% / 3 mm Gamma test achieved 94.4% to 98.2% passing rate. Conclusions : This study established the RLO correction values in our department. We found the default RLO values are obviously inaccurate for our machine. This adjustment of RLO table improves the dose calculation accuracy of TPS, in the meantime, ensures the quality of patients’treatments.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose : Pencil Beam Convolution (PBC) and Analytical Anisotropic Algorithm (AAA) were used to calculate the surface dose of simulated phantoms for head-and-neck patients treated with intensitymodulated radiation therapy. These were also used to evaluate the reliability of calculated results for the skin dose in vivo head-and-neck patients. Materials and Methods : This experiment adopted 0.1 mm ultrathin thermoluminescent dosimeters (ultrathin TLD) and ISP Gafchromic EBT2 film as measurement tools. The surface doses at hypothetical neck lymphatic regions were measured. Seven-field IMRT plans with a prescribed dose of 180 cGy were designed using an Eclipse (version10.0) treatment planning system where both PBC and AAA were implemented. These two different measurement tools were used to measure the absolute dose when calculated algorithms used different grid sizes. Result : In this experiment the variance coefficient of ultrathin TLD was within 3%. The reading values and delivered doses were in a good linear relationship. The points on calibration curve of Gafchromic film were within 1%. Using grid size of 2.5 mm, the errors between calculated values (PBC and AAA) and the mean surface measured doses for EBT2 film and ultrathin TLD were 13.02%, 10.73% and -4.54%, -6.48% on right side and -12.52%, -10.06% and -4.58%, -1.9% on left side neck of IMRT head/neck phantom, respectively. The errors between calculated values (PBC and AAA) and the mean surface measured doses for EBT2 film and ultrathin TLD were -0.99%, -2.26% and 0.64%, -0.64% on right side and -7.68%, -12.47% and 2.9%, -2.44% on left side neck of anthropomorphic Rando® phantom, respectively. Thus, AAA had more stable calculated results and performance than PBC using a grid size of 2.5 mm. Conclusion and Discussion : From the experimental results, neither algorithm was precise in calculating the surface dose. However, AAA was closer to the measured dose and its performance was stable. Future research will evaluate the most precise algorithm and modify the contours of the body to evaluate the skin dose. The treatment planning system can then be used directly to calculate patients’ skin dose indeed affecting the skin reaction.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'The triad of colonic polyposis, mesenchymal tumors of the skin or soft tissues, and osteomas, is known as Gardner syndrome (GS). This syndrome is inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait that occurs in approximately half of the children of afflicted parents. GS is the variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and shares the same genetic disorder as FAP. The fact that GS is associated with extra-colonic manifestations may be the result of a variable penetrance of a common genetic mutation. GS may present osteomas of the bones, sebaceous or epidermoid cysts, fibromas, neurofibromas, lipomas, pigmented skin lesions, or fibromatosis. The deep fibromatosis is most commonly referred to as a desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis in the literature, and appears in only approximately 3-5% of affected individuals with GS. Treatment of fibromatosis is indicated only when it causes clinical symptoms, dysfunction of adjacent structures, or aesthetic concerns. Surgical excision is generally advised first; however, there may be local recurrence even following a wide resection. Local radiotherapy could be used in un-resectable or recurrent fibromatosis for symptoms alleviation. We present two rare cases of GS in a family with recurrent fibromatosis after repeated excision. The tumor caused clinical symptoms, affected daily life and had negative aesthetic effects. A 50-54 Gy radiation dose in 1.8-2 Gy fractions was delivered to the involved tumor region in a 5-6 week course. Fibromatosis responded to radiotherapy, and the tumor regressed during serial follow-ups for more than a year. Radiation therapy achieved satisfactory results in local control and cosmetic outcome. The pain and disfiguration could all be ameliorated. Treatment was well tolerated, with only Grade 1 radiation dermatitis, mucositis, and xerostomia using the acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Our results support that radiotherapy could be used as salvage therapy for such recurrent benign tumors.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Background and purpose : Betel nut chewing is associated with oral cavity cancer in Taiwan. Radiotherapy is one of the therapeutic approaches. Our previous study demonstrated that microRNA (miR)-17-5p (one of the miR-17-92 polycistronic miRNAs) was enhanced in the irradiated OC3 cancer cell line (which was established from oral squamous cell carcinoma in a long-term betel nut chewer who did not smoke), and miR-17-5p was also found to inhibit downstream protein p21 expression and induce radiosensitivity. In this study, we used a human apoptosis protein array to clarify which apoptosis-related proteins are modulated by miR-17-5p. Materials and Methods : Total cell lysates from OC3 cells with control small interfering (si)RNA or miR-17-5p were used to analyze apoptosis-related proteins. A specific miR- 17-5p effector apoptosis-related protein was confirmed by Western blotting. To confirm the role of p53 in irradiated OC-3 cells, OC3 cells without or with a p53-overexpressing clone were irradiated and examined by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Results : Using a human apoptosis protein array analysis (R&D Systems; catalog # ARY009), we simultaneously detected the relative expressions of 35 apoptosis-related proteins in OC3 cells that were treated with an miR-17-5p antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ODN) or a control ODN. Several proteins, including p21, p53, TNF RI, FADD, cIAP-1, HIF-1α, and TRAIL R1, were found to be up- or downregulated by miR-17-5p in OC3 cells; their expression patterns were also confirmed by Western blotting. We further clarified the role of p53 in irradiated OC3 cells, using a p53 overexpression strategy, and results revealed that enhancement of p53 expression significantly enhanced radiation-induced G2/M arrest of OC3 cells. Conclusions : miR-17-5p regulated the apoptosis-related proteins of p21, p53, TNF RI, FADD, cIAP-1, HIF-1α, and TRAIL R1 in OC3 cells; interestingly, its effect on p53 protein expression contributed to modulating the cell cycle arrest of OC3 cells.'},\n",

Materials and Methods: Between April 2008 and October 2012, 72 patients with pathologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma were included. Age ranged from 58 to 89 with mean age of 73 years. Twenty-three patients were intermediate-risk group and 49 were high-risk group. Fifty-one and 21 patients were treated with Helical Tomotherapy and RapidArc respectively. The mean radiation dose was 74 Gy. Twenty patients were treated with external beam radiation therapy alone (EBRT-only group) and 52 were treated with EBRT plus androgen deprivation therapy (EBRT-ADT group). The biochemical failure was defined by a rise of 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir prostate specific antigen (PSA). The nadir was defined as lowest PSA value preceding a given threshold of 0.2 ng/mL or as absolutely lowest PSA before the transient bounce. Toxicities were assessed and documented in agreement with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3 (CTCAE v.3.0). Results: With the mean follow-up period of 28 months, four patients (5%, 4/72) had biochemical failure. The mean time interval to achieve the nadir PSA (TnPSA) in the EBRT-only group and EBRT-ADT group were 15.58 months and 5.73 months respectively (p = 0.001).

A margin of 5 mm was added to the clinical target volume (CTV) to generate a planned target volume (PTV). We shifted the isocenters in the planning system with errors, fraction by fraction, to simulate the situation without IGRT.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: Evaluation of NIPAM gel dosimeter under respiratory motion to verify radiotherapy treatment plan. Materials and Methods: We used a self-designed NIPAM gel dosimeter and a set of NIPAM gel calibration tubes to perform the experiment. The calibration tubes and gel dosimeter were set on a movable device which simulated respiratory movement of the chest. The movement parameters of the calibration tubes and the gel dosimeter were: ±10 mm cephalic and caudal displacement (20 mm in total), and a period of 4 seconds. Correction and gel dosimeter before irradiation CT images were taken by CT simulator. The calibration tube was made by filling NIPAM gel into a test tube. For each calibration tube, a specific radiation dose of 0,1, 2, 5, 8,10 Gy (6 MV photon) was given respectively by a Varian iX Linear accelerator. MRI scan was then performed to each calibration tube after irradiation and the T2 value obtained was converted to R2 value before a calibration curve was plotted. Another cylinder was also filled with NIPAM gel. A treatment plan of bilateral tangential forward field-in-field IMRT was done by Varian Eclipse planning system. The gel dosimeter was then irradiated up to 5.4 Gy (6 MV photon) with Varian iX linear accelerator using the treatment plan generated by the treatment planning system. A MRI scan was then performed, and the image data was than analyzed with MATLAB to evaluate dose curve change between the treatment plan and the gel dosimeter. Results: The sensitivity of the calibration gel dosimeter was 0.1353 s^(-1)/Gy. The correlation coefficient (R^2) of the calibration curve was 0.9952. In axial sections, when comparing dose distribution of the treatment plan and the gel dosimeter, 70% and 80% isodose curves were in high concordance. In sagittal and coronal views, the area of low dose region (＜ 60% isodose curves) in the gel dosimeter was larger than that of the treatment plan. In addition, the area of high dose region in the treatment plan was larger than that of the gel dosimeter. Conclusion: We demonstrated three-dimensional dose distribution of the NIPAM gel dosimeter with respiratory motion, had high concordance with that of the calculated treatment plan. Therefore using NIPAM gel dosimeter to verify radiotherapy treatment plan with respiratory motion is feasible.'},\n",

Materials and Methods: The structure and fields of three commercial records and verify systems were identified and studied. A web application programming interface was implemented to perform the following three tasks: 1. Pre-defined fields were queried from each database using PHP and standard SQL language, 2. The retrieved data were rearranged and consolidated to fulfill clinical needs, 3. The patients' treatment histories were summarized and exported to hospital information system via JSON format. The performance of the web API, commercial applications, and with manual transfer of paper charts were measured by analysis of query time for twenty patients. Results: The system has been transparently incorporated into our radiation treatment planning workflow. The website-based database interface has allowed authorized users with minimal training to extract patient's daily treatment from the database anytime and anywhere in the hospital. The query time significantly decreased using this system. Conclusions : The web application programming interface can integrate patient's treatment data from different commercial treatment machines and export to hospital information system. The application breakthrough the vendor's limitation, and is helpful in developing radiotherapy electronic medical records.

       "  'e': 'Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant neoplasm with a poor survival worldwide. In the 2012 cancer registration report showed a prevalence rate about 7.5% of all hepatobiliary malignancy in Taiwan whereas it was 10 - 15% in the world. The overall 5-year survival rate is only 20 - 30% in literature. Surgical resection is the mainstay treatment for operable patients. However, complete microscopic (R0) resection is difficult to achieve due to the complicated distribution of vessel network and close surrounding normal organs. Thus, the role of post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy is important but normal tissue radiation tolerance remains a critical issue. By using intraoperative radiaotherapy (IORT), the target lesion could be irradiated with single high-dose fraction while avoiding surrounding tissues. Here, we presented a 78-year-old male with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma without regional lymphadenopathy. IORT with 20 Gy via a portable kilovoltage x-ray generator was delivered in operative room after removal of tumor and surrounding tissues. The pathology report showed close surgical margin and no regional lymph node metastasis. No further adjuvant external beam radiotherapy or chemotherapy was given due to none of major risk factor and old age. After 6-month follow up, no evidence of recurrence and complication was noted. We conclude that IORT might be a safe radiotherapy modality for patients with resectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

       "  'e': 'Background : Endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) is a rare malignant tumor of the uterus. Few extrauterine ESS cases arising in vagina and pelvic cavity were reported. The main treatment for extrauterine ESS is surgical resection; however the role of radiotherapy in extrauterine ESS remained unclear. We aimed to explore the value of radiotherapy treating low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LGESS), especially in extrauterine. We presented one case of extrauterine LGESS arising in vaginal wall with surgical treatment and adjuvant radiotherapy and the second case arising from pelvic cavity treated with tumor-directed radiotherapy alone. Case Presentation : Case 1: A 39-year-old woman presented with symptom of excessive vaginal bleeding. A polyp tumor protruding from the vagina wall near cervical os was found on speculum examination. She underwent surgical removal of the mass. The microscopic examination revealed LGESS. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed using external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions and brachytherapy with a dose of 3 Gy x 2 fractions. Case 2: A 59-year-old woman had a past history of abdominal total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to intramural leiomyoma at age 45 years. She presented with progressive lower abdominal pain and anuria for days. Contrast-enhanced CT scan showed a 8x5 cm soft tissue mass over left pelvic cavity close to trigone of urinary bladder and left ureter, with involvement of vaginal vault apex. Biopsy revealed LGESS. She received tumor-directed radiotherapy with a dose of 72 Gy in 40 fractions without surgical resection. Conclusions: Radiotherapy provide lower recurrence rate, but the result of overall survival was still in controversy. It can be considered in patients who are unsuitable for surgical resection. Our 2 cases had no evidence of recurrence in 1 year and 12 years of follows-up. Because of the paucity of extrauterine ESS, further investigation is needed to determine the benefit of radiotherapy.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: The intent of this study was to compare the dosimetry of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and organs at risk (OARs) in left breast cancer patients in two treatment techniques, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and 3-dimentional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients with left breast cancer who had received post-operative radiotherapy (RT) to the breast between October 2012 and November 2013 were enrolled in the study. All patients were irradiated with 6- or 10-MV photon beams using 3-dimentional conformal tangential technique to the left whole breast. For dosimetric comparison, two sets of six-field IMRT plans, with or without LAD constraint of V20 Gy＜50%, on each patient were performed. These three RT plans were named tangential field (TF), non-LAD constraint (NLC) and LAD constraint (LC), respectively. Five patients also received supraclavicular fossa (SCF) irradiation, but only whole breast dosimetry parameters were analyzed. The conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI) and dose-volume histogram (DVH) for the LAD, heart and ipsilateral lung were calculated for analysis. Repeated measures of one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test (software SPSS 21.0) was used for statistics. Results: For the 14 patients given left breast irradiation, there was an obvious statistical benefit for HI (average 12.67%) and CI (average 92.95%) by IMRT (both p＜0.0001). According to the data, it was found that an LAD mean dose (Dmean), V20 Gy, V30 Gy and LAD area mean dose (LAD of 10 mm in all directions) were reduced by using the LC arm (average 20.28 Gy, 41.19%, 29.60% and 21.46 Gy, respectively) if using IMRT technique (all p＜0.05). However, there was no statistical difference between TF and LC arms (p＞0.05). Additionally, although the low dose bath (LAD V5 Gy average 82.81%) was a drawback in IMRT (p＜0.05), the LC arm was still better than the NLC arm if the LAD constraint was used (p=0.013). There was no statistical significance between the 3 arms in regard to LAD maximum dose (Dmax) (3-arm average 47.21 Gy). 3DCRT had lower heart Dmean (average 3.77 Gy), ipsilateral lung Dmean (average 7.14 Gy) and V5 Gy (average 19.21%) than with IMRT (average 6.10 Gy, 9.31 Gy and 38.57%, respectively) (all p＜0.0001), and there was no statistical difference between IMRT arms (p＞0.05). Conclusion: In the light of our dosimetric data, IMRT may offer much better HI and CI than conventional tangential-field RT. In order to decrease the high-dose area of LAD, we had to select an appropriate LAD constraint (in this study, LAD V20 Gy ＜50% was used), if IMRT planning was done. IMRT technique results in a low dose bath (V5 Gy) and we should use this treatment option carefully. Further investigation for LAD constraint is needed.'},\n",

Material and Methods: Mean CT numbers were determined for planning CT and CBCT for the same selected regions of air, tissue, and bone. Based on CT-density tables for the planning CT, the density of CBCT could be determined for a selected volume. After generating linear regression equations for both the CT-density table and the CBCT-density table, the CT numbers for CBCT could be modified to fit the planning CT-density table. The field of view (FOV) boundaries in the corrected CBCT images were identified and merged with the planning CT images to provide real scatter and attenuation data. Images of 2 phantoms and 12 patients were used to verify the accuracy of corrected CBCT doses. Results: Based on Pinnacle TPS calculations, the differences in point dose between CBCT and CT images in the phantom study were 0.71% (SD=1.73%) at 6 MV, and 0.49% (SD=1.39%) at 10 MV. The 2D passing rates for a gamma index were 97.46% (SD=4.08%) at 6 MV, and 99.32% (SD=0.90%) at 10 MV. The dose difference of D95% was 0.48%±1.19%. The difference in planning target volume (PTV) coverage of the prescribed dose was 0.36%±1.69%, and the 2D passing rate without threshold was 98.06%±1.66%. Conclusion: Patient-specific correction of daily CBCT images can be used for reconstructing daily dose distribution and is practicable for radiotherapy treatment and clinical evaluations.'},\n",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the interplay of dose rate setting and gantry speed during RapidArc optimization, and analyzing treatment planning and plan verify results to find out the most suitable dose rate setting. Materials and Methods: Thirteen patients included three head and neck, five esophageal and prostate patients were selected to re-optimize the treatment plan of RapidArc by setting six different dose rate (100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 MU/min). All re-optimized plans used the same dose constraint and priority for planned target volume and critical organ. Compare the results of the homogeneity index (HI) and conformal index (CI) in the tumor, the dose received by critical organs, monitor unit numbers, delivery time and plan verified by setting different dose rate. Result: All plans results showed that there was no evidence and trend toward improved plan quality for clinical case was observed with any dose rate. When setting high dose rate, gantry maximal speed was the main consideration then it was more flexible in modulating gantry speed and dose rate and using more arcs in plan also did. The main advantage of setting high dose rate was saving total treatment time. But not mean that it must be setting the maximum dose rate (600 MU/min). Conclusion: RapidArc plan was complex and limited by amounts of cases in this study, but high dose rate had high dynamic range in gantry speed modulation. No doubt high dose rate could reduce total treatment time.'},\n",

However, most medical records systems for radiation oncology in Taiwan are independent from hospital information systems (HIS), or asynchronous with HIS. It is difficult to gather information on radiation oncology for other members of cancer treatment team. Therefore, the aim of this study is to build an EMR system, which integrates with both HIS and the cancer registry database, to achieve efficient, safe, instant transfer of information. Materials & Methods: The needs of radiation oncology medical records, the existing processes, and the functions of the cancer registry system were identified first. By applying Java and web technology under J2EE architecture, we developed an electronic medical records system. Considering the characteristics of information storage and the need for future statistical analysis, we defined the information in the notes as different forms. We built a web-based version of the cancer registry system integrated with HIS, using the concept of reverse engineering. The data from the previous cancer registry system was imported and converted to be compatible with the new system to achieve the goal of online operation and real-time search. Results: The electronic medical records system included initial notes, acute radiation morbidity records, brachytherapy notes, complete notes, and a cancer registry database. By integrating with the HIS and sharing the information, we can reduce the time and possible mistakes clinicians spend on medical records and repeated inputing. The instant transparency for other members of the cancer treatment team are improved by the system as well. Conclusions: The electronic medical records designed by this study not only reduce documentation time, but also build a database containing complete patient history and other cancer information for retrospective study or clinical trial. It is also more flexible in response to changes in medical records policy.'},\n",

Materials and Methods: This retrospective review included 167 consecutive patients with major and minor salivary gland carcinomas from 2001 to 2011.

The median cumulative radiation doses were 66 Gy for both groups, and cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapies were the most commonly used regimens. Results: The median follow-up was 5.4 years for survivors. Although patients receiving POCRT possessed more adverse pathological prognosticators and higher cancer stages, there were no statistical differences in locoregional control (LRC), diseasefree survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) between the PORT and POCRT groups according to early or advanced stage. However, a trend towards LRC improvement was observed in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) undergoing POCRT, with 100% 5-year LRC compared with 81% for those treated with PORT (P=.057). In subgroup analyses, POCRT provided significant LRC advantages over PORT for ACC patients who also exhibited positive surgical margins (P=.022) or perineural invasion (P=.043).

However, the experience has been limited to flourauracilbased chemoradiation. A retrospective analysis of gemcitabine based CCRT as primary treatment for loco-regional cholangiocarcinoma in our institute was performed. Materials and Methods: Between April, 2004 and December, 2012, 26 patients (M/F=17/9; median age=66years) with cholangiocarcinoma (14 intrahepatic primary and 12 perihilar or extrahepatic primary) were treated with curative intent at our department. Baseline performance status based on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) was 0-1 in 22 patients and 2 in 4 patients. Nine had regional extension of the diseases (defined as metastasis in either regional or para-aortic lymph nodes), whereas 17 had localized (T1-4N0M0) disease. The median equivalent dose in 2 Gy (EQD2) was 52.0 Gy (range: 40-72.1 Gy). Concurrent chemotherapy was low dose gemcitabine at 400 mg/m2 given weekly to biweekly. Both univariateand multivariate analyses were used to identify statistically significant prognostic factors. Results: The median survival of the entire cohort was 13.2 months. Survival rates at 1 and 2 year were 53% and 8% respectively. Patients of better performance status (ECOG 0-1) had improved median survival in comparison to those who of poorer baseline performance status (ECOG 2) (16.9 months vs. 1.5 months, p=0.045) on univariate analysis. Younger age (＜ 66 years) trended towards improved median survival (28.0 months vs. 4.8 months, p=0.055). There was eight local failures, two of which were isolated local failures. There were two treatment-related deaths. Conclusions: Outcome of low dose gemcitabine CCRT for cholangiocarcinoma seems promising. Those with better baseline performance status are most likely to benefit from this treatment.

Materials and Methods: This experiment adopted 0.1mm ultrathin thermoluminescent dosimeters (ultrathin TLD) and ISP Gafchromic EBT film as the measured tool to establish the characteristics. Superficial doses of home-made breast on anthropomorphic Rando phantom were measured. FIF and ISC plans with a prescribed dose of 180 cGy were designed on this phantom using an Eclipse treatment planning system and using two measured tools to measure the absolute surface dose. Result: In this experiment the variance coefficient of TLD film was within 3%. The reading values and delivered doses were in a good linear relationship. The points on calibration curve of Gafchromic film were within 1% and in a stable performance. Mean surface measured doses of FIF and ISC with the EBT film and TLD film were 108.74 ± 14.86 cGy, 107.35 ± 15.93 cGy and 103.19 ± 12.91 cGy, 102.09 ± 10.02 cGy, respectively. The error between EBT film and TLD film for the inner, middle, outer, upper, lower regions of home-made breast and the total mean dose of FIF was 5.17%, -3.45%, 1.58%, 1.27%, -0.55% and 1.3%, respectively; the error between EBT film and TLD film for the inner, middle, outer, upper, lower regions of home-made breast and the total mean dose of ISC was 1.86%, 2.94%, 8.3%, -3.44%, -5% and 1.08%, respectively. Conclusion and Discussion: From the experimental results, ultrathin TLD and EBT film can be adopted as the measured tools for surface dose of breast cancer patients. The future work for this research could gather statistics of the skin reactions indeed affected by the skin dose received from radiation for clinical applications. To evaluate severity of skin reaction and measure most accurate skin dose, and this data can be used references for skin reaction gradings.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To analyze the treatment outcomes of radiation therapy (RT) in breast cancer patients who developed locoregional recurrence (LRR) after initial treatment with mastectomy, and to investigate the prognostic factors influencing survival. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of breast cancer patients who received RT for post-mastectomy LRR in our hospital from 1989 to 2009. Patients who had previous RT and distant metastasis before LRR were excluded, but patients with synchronous distant metastasis were included in this study. Clinicopathologic parameters and outcomes were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate local recurrence progression-free survival (LRPFS), distant metastasis -free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to assess the prognostic significance of these clinicopathologic parameters on survival. Results: One hundred and fifty-five patients were included in the study. Median followup time was 9.8 years. Thirty-one (20.0%) patients had synchronous metastasis at the diagnosis of LRR, while 124 (80%) patients had not. The median OS for patients with and without synchronous metastasis were 1.6 and 4.2 years, respectively (P= 0.001), but there was no difference on LRPFS between these two groups (P= 0.33). Among the 124 patients without synchronous metastasis, the 5-year LRPFS, DMFS and OS for were 58.9%, 35.4% and 46%, respectively. Eighty-three patients (67%) subsequently developed distant metastases. Patients with chest wall recurrence had a significantly better 5-year OS than patients with isolated LN or multiple sites recurrences (56.3% vs. 39.8% vs. 27.8%, P= 0.04). Multivariate analysis for patients without synchronous metastasis revealed that sites of LRR and initial stage were significant prognostic factors for LRPFS, while aggressive local therapy (including surgery and RT), initial stage and salvage systemic therapy were significant prognostic factors affecting OS. Conclusions: Locoregional recurrent breast cancer carries a high risk of distant metastasis. Use of aggressive local therapy and systemic therapy can achieve good survival outcomes in a substantial proportion of patients.'},\n",

Methods and Materials: Twenty-one consecutive patients with left-sided breast cancer who underwent adjuvant radiotherapy to the breast between August 2012 and October 2013 are enrolled in our study. All patients were irradiated with 6- or 10-MV tangential beams to the breast and seven patients of them also received supraclavicular fossa (SCF) irradiation with IMRT technique. For each dose plan, dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the heart and LADCA were calculated and analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship between average heart D_(mean) (mean dose), LAD D_(mean) and LAD_(max) (maximum dose) and between LAD D_(mean) and volume of LADCA in the radiation fields (i.e., it received ＞25 Gy). Student's t test was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in radiation dose to LADCA and heart between patients who received SCF IMRT or not. Results: For the 21 patients given left breast irradiation, the average mean [range] dose was 4.04 [1.75-11.15] Gy to the heart and 21.29 [6.99-35.28] Gy to the LADCA, and the average maximum dose was 54.31 [50.55-58.42] Gy to the LADCA. There is significant correlation between D_(mean) to the heart and LADCA (r= 0.80, p ＜ 0.01). The D_(mean) to LADCA was postulated to increase 3.44 Gy for each increase of 1 Gy in the mean radiation dose delivered to the heart in our study. There is significant correlation between Dmean to LADCA and the volume of LAD in the radiation fields (i.e., it received ＞25 Gy) (r= 0.94, p＜ 0.0001). The D_(mean) to LADCA was postulated to increase 0.77 Gy for each increase of 1 ml of LADCA volume in the radiation field. For 7 patients who received left-tangential radiotherapy and SCF IMRT, the average mean dose was 4.15 [2.58-8.9] Gy to the heart and 21.93 [16.49-35.21] Gy to the LADCA, and the average maximum dose was 55.21 [52.63-57.79] Gy to the LADCA. SCF IMRT contributed to average mean dose 0.15 [0.05-0.35] Gy and average maximum dose 0.43 [0.15-0.68] Gy to the LADCA. There is no significant difference in Dmean to the LADCA and heart between patients who received SCF IMRT or not (p= 0.38, p= 0.45, respectively). Conclusion: For patients receiving left-tangential radiotherapy, the higher Dmean to the LADCA was strongly correlated to the larger volume of LADCA in the radiation fields. There is significant correlation between D_(mean) to the heart and LADCA. The patients with the higher mean heart dose had the higher mean LADCA dose. We may suggest to limit mean dose to LADCA by avoiding volume of LADCA in the treatment fields if well visualized LADCA on CT scan or limiting the mean heart dose to lower mean LADCA dose if poor visualization of LADCA on CT scan.\"},\n",

Materials and Approaches: A Clinac iX linear accelerator (Varian, USA) was adopted as the radiation source to irradiate an N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) polymer gel dosimetry. After the polymerization reaction, the gel was scanned using a HiSpeed CT scanner (GE, USA), and sliced images of the gel were analyzed using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Next, the gamma test obtained for the treatment plan and the NIPAM polymer gel were compared. Results: The results indicated that using numerous CT images to calculate the mean CT numbers of the images can substantially reduce CT noise. In addition, when the polymer gel was unilluminated and background subtraction occurred, the ring artifacts produced in the first experiment disappeared. Furthermore, the gamma test increased from 68.40% to 95.02% pass rate. The gel dose distribution yielded in the second experiment was similar to that of the treatment plan system, and the obtained gamma test was 97.57% pass rate.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To investigate the performance and feasibilities of four different linac-based radiation therapy devices in palliating a lung adenocarcinoma patient presenting with diffuse pleural seeding and intractable pain. Patients and Methods: Treatment plans were generated for three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), Volumetric- modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and Helical Tomotherapy (HT) using 6 MV photon beam with adequate optimization criteria. The total prescribed dose to planning target volume (PTV) was 50 Gy in 20 fractions. Dose distributions to PTV and organs at risk (OAR) were compared using dose-volume histograms (DVHs), conformity indexes (CIs), and homogeneity indexes (HIs). Results: In general, IMRT, VMAT and HT all resulted in comparable PTV coverage. The D98 of all four techniques were all greater than 48.5 Gy. HT had the highest CI (0.982) and the lowest HI (0.035), whereas 3D-CRT had the highest D2% (56.82 Gy) and Dmax (58 Gy). HT had the lowest ipsilateral lung V45 (55%) and ipsilateral mean lung dose (45 Gy). 3D-CRT had the lowest contralateral lung V18 (0%) and contralateral mean lung dose (1.14 Gy). The integral dose (L.Gy) for total lung tissue was VMAT ＞ HT ＞ IMRT ＞ 3D-CRT. HT delivered the most monitor units (MUs) and needed the longest treatment time. Conclusion: IMRT, VMAT and HT all could attain over 95% PTV coverage and had superior OAR sparing compared to 3D-CRT. However, larger volumes of some healthy tissues (especially contralateral lung) received low-to-intermediate doses, which contributed to a higher integral dose in VMAT, HT and IMRT. The superiority of one technique over another needed further clinical correlation.'},\n",

In practice, however, some patients would like to participate in the survey and answer the questionnaire but may be unwilling to sign the consent form. This study was designed to investigate: (1) The proportion of participants unwilling to sign the consent form. (2) If the questionnaire was anonymous and didn't involve patient's privacy and medical interests, can the consent form be waived? (3) If the patient takes the questionnaire home, answers it, and returns to the investigators, can this be regarded as a voluntary response? Materials and Methods: The questionnaires were distributed to patients in four different groups consecutively. The informed consent process of these groups were designed to differ a little so as to identify their effects on the response rate, the rate of unsigned consent form, and the invalid questionnaire rate. Results: Except the first group (asking the patient to sign the consent form), the other groups (at the patient’s discretion) had about 20 to 30% of the respondents who declined to sign the consent form. In the second group, the informed consent process was too simplistic; hence it had the lowest response rate. In the first and the third groups, the informed consent process was more elaborate, but the invalid rate was high. In the fourth group, the informed consent process was the most complete, as a result, the response rate was high and the invalid rate was the lowest. Conclusion: (1) At the patient's discretion, about 20 to 30 percent of the respondents declined to sign the consent form. (2) If an anonymous questionnaire does not involve patient's privacy and medical interests, instructions may be used instead (without requiring a signature as evidence) lest the patient feel uneasy. (3) If a participant takes the questionnaire home, answers it, and returns to the investigator, this may be regarded as a voluntary response.\"},\n",

The most important prognostic factor of this tumor is stage, with 10-year overall survival of 84-95% for stage I tumors, decreasing to 50-65% for stage II tumors, and to 0-22% for stage III and IV disease. Case report: A 56-year-old woman with left side ovarian granulosa cell tumor, at least clinical FIGO stage IIIa, underwent debulking operation on February 23rd, 2002. After surgery, she received four cycles adjuvant chemotherapy with the regimen of Bleomycin, Cisplatin and Etoposide. Then she received postoperative whole-abdomen and pelvis irradiation. The dose was given 2520 cGy in 21 fractions with liver and kidney shielding. After whole-abdomen and pelvis irradiation, she received pelvis boost with the dose of 1980 cGy in 11 fractions. Since then, she was regularly followed at our hospital until now without any signs of tumor recurrence nor tumor progression. Discussion: Until now there is no standard and proven treatment for GCT patients, especially when they suffered from advanced-stage or recurrent unresectable tumors. Complete tumor resection should be considered as the primary treatment. The optimal choice of combination platinum-based chemotherapy is still not well-defined. The role of adjuvant radiation therapy remains controversial. We suggested that adjuvant RT for patients with GCT might improve outcomes in selected patients.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: Radiation therapy is an important treatment method for head and neck cancer. The parotid gland, submandibular gland and minor salivary gland are often irradiated due to being adjacent to the target volumes. Although advancing radiotherapy techniques have reduced the dose of radiation to normal tissues and toxicity, the radiation dose distributed to the parotid gland remains high, causing a considerable amount of xerostomia. The aim of this study is to reduce the dose of radiation to the left parotid gland by inserting a spacer into the medial parotid space and separating it from the target volume. Materials and Methods: A minimally invasive procedure was developed to create a space medial to the left parotid gland in experimental swine, and a spacer was inserted into this space. A computed tomography simulator and radiation therapy planning system was used to analyze the distribution of the radiation dose to the putative gross disease, high risk clinical target volume, and parotid glands. Statistics obtained by using a paired t test were used to compare the dosimetry parameters with or without the insertion of the spacer. Results: The dose of radiation to the parotid glands was found to be significantly reduced by the demand for a similar coverage and conformity of the putative target volume for the gross disease (PTV 70 Gy) and high risk nodal region (PTV 63 Gy) with 2 Gy per fraction. Before the space was created, the left and right parotid glands were estimated to receive a mean dose of 2808 ± 205 cGy and 2901 ± 189 cGy, respectively. After the spacer was inserted into the left medial parotid gland space, the left and right parotid glands were estimated to receive a mean dose of 2027 ± 364 cGy and 2972 ± 114 cGy respectively. Therefore, the spacer had made a significant difference in the dose to the ipsilateral (left) parotid gland (p=0.003) without affecting the contralateral (right) one (p=0.36). Conclusion: An experimental model was developed by using spacers to create a space between the left parotid gland and the target volume, which markedly reduced the dose to the left parotid gland. Both short and long term functional assays for parotid damage in animals is warranted.'},\n",

A one-touch solution to integrate diverse information systems was proposed to readily access radiotherapy information in real time wherever and whenever needed. Materials and Methods: First, we identified all existing processes and the distribution of information between HIS in the hospital and MOSAIQ in the department of radiation oncology. Then a one-touch solution (OTS) was implemented using several information technologies, including HL7 message exchange, SQL query, and dynamic web pages. It allowed authenticated users to obtain the radiotherapy information such as treatment sites, dose and fractions, and start/end date of radiotherapy on authorized computer workstations or mobile devices in an intuitive and rapid way. Results: The ability to exchange data between MOSAIQ and hospital HIS with just one touch was successfully implemented for daily clinical use. The mean time for users to retrieve up-to-date radiotherapy information for each patient and record it in hospital HIS was significantly decreased to 1 sec with OTS compared to 12.7 sec with searching data in MOSAIQ and 47.1 sec with manual transfer of paper charts (p＜0.05 for both comparisons). Conclusion: OTS can facilitate the exchange of radiotherapy data between different information systems. It can free up radiation oncologists from doing repetitive tasks, and allow them to focus on other important tasks to improve the quality and safety of radiotherapy.'},\n",

To evaluate the set-up errors and dose impact at clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (PTV) coverage and critical organ with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT); off-line re-optimization and online re-positioning have been used clinically. Materials and Methods: Between 2011 and 2013, 12 patients with prostate cancer were treated with IGRT to a dose of 75.6 Gy with daily correction of the target position based on Elekta Synergy X-ray cone beam computed tomography system, image-guided radiation therapy practiced with VMAT. We captured each space coordinates in every fraction with dose redistribution to form a new dose distribution with the Pyton software. The real dose with recalculation and stacking with new three dimensional coordinates from each fraction were compared with initial plan. The dose at CTV, PTV coverage and critical organ were reevaluated. Results: The average shift of ML (medial-lateral), CC (cranio-caudal) and AP (anterior-posterior) were 2 mm±1 mm, 3 mm±3 mm and 4 mm±3 mm. The calculated systematic errors in ML, AP and CC direction were 0.8 mm, 2.0 mm and 1.6 mm. The calculated random errors in ML, AP and CC direction were 1.22 mm, 1.7 mm and 2.1 mm. The coverage of CTV and PTV with recalculation were significantly decreased from 100% to 96% and 97.5% to 86.9% respectively. There was no statistical difference in the dose to organ at risk. IGRT will be necessary in our study. Though CTV coverage decrease from 100% to 96%, but the PTV coverage decrease from 97.5% to 86.9% reaching statistical significance. Conclusions: IGRT would be beneficial for prostate cancer treatment with VMAT really. CBCT image guide VMAT in radiotherapy to prostate cancer not only shortened the treatment time but also decreased the uncertainty of set-up within each fraction. The specific dose to critical organs and tumor would be more exact compared with radiotherapy without IGRT. The less side effect and better tumor control might be expected in the future after proof of new randomized clinical trial.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose : To investigate the feasibility of using PTW 2D-Array detecting system in IMRT dosimetric quality assurance, we propose a mathematical and efficient method. The method uses the multiple acquisition sequence to increase the resolution. Then the measured results and calculated results are analyzed and compared. Materials and Methods: We use PTW-seven29 2D Array as the detecting system and PTW-RW3 Slab Phantom as solid phantom. With 15 cm-thickness solid phantom and CT images, the dosimetric distribution is calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). The phantom source surface distance (SSD) is 95 cm and the 2D distribution at the 5 cm depth is as the calculated result. By combining the measured results in different acquisition sequence, we can get the dosimetric distribution in different theory resolution. The relation between the low-resolution and high-resolution results is analyzed. In advance we combine the calculated result to get the Gamma index in different theory resolution. Results: We find that using the multiple acquisition sequence really increases the measured resolution in the 2D-Array detecting system. And the number of measuring times is direct ratio to the theoretic resolution. For example combining the four-times measures in different position can get the fourfold-theory resolution. In comparing the measured results with calculated results, the fourfold-theory resolution is the most efficient and passes the Gamma index test. However using eightfold-theory resolution is better but needs more time in quality assurance.

A subarcuate AEF was highly suspected with contrast flow along the esophagus noted in the contrast test series. No definite feeding arterial branch of the hemorrhagic lesion could be recognized, thus an embolizing procedure was not performed. Then he received emergent descending aortic endografting for AEF. His hemodynamic status and oxygenation became relatively stable. However, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and passed away three days later. The aorta consists of strong muscular layer, and we do not believe the moderate dose of radiotherapy alone induced such rare complication. We are inclined to assume that solid food induced a penetrating ulcer of the esophagus and thoracic aorta after improvement of dysphagia.

Materials and Methods : During 2003 and 2010, 564 consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of prostate receiving radical definitive radiotherapy in our institution were retrospectively reviewed with a median follow-up of 63 months. Among the 542 patients without evident lymphadenopathy (N0) on CT or MRI, there were 97 (17.2%), 181 (32.1%), 214 (37.9%), and 50 (8.9%) in low, intermediate, high, and very high risk groups respectively, based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk classification criteria. Another 22 (3.9%) patients showed regional lymphadenopathy (N1). Median prescription dose was 78 Gy. There were 453 (80.3%) patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Among them, 62 (11.1%) received adjuvant ADT for more than 2 years. Results : The 5-year overall survival (OS), disease specific survival (DSS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) and biochemical failure free survival (BFFS) of all patients were 90.3%, 97.9%, 94%, and 87.1% respectively. The 5-year BFFS were 98.2%, 94.6%, 81.2%, and 75.7% for patients of low, intermediate, high, and very high risk groups, respectively. For patients with N1 disease, the 5-year BFFS was down to 49.9%. The difference of BFFS between patients of high and very high risk groups was significant only in those who had MRI for staging. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that T-stage, Gleason score, and initial PSA risk groups, and age of 80 or older were significant risk factors of BFFS. Pelvic irradiation significantly increased acute GI toxicity with odds ratio of 1.486 (95% confidence interval 1.059-2.086). Grade 3 or more late toxicity was noted in 23 patients (4.1%) in GU system and 33 patients (5.9%) in GI system. Only 4 (0.7%) patients had persistent GU toxicity and 1 (0.2%) had persistent GI toxicity at the last follow-up date. Multivariate Cox regression showed the mean dose to rectum above 48 Gy to be the only significant factor for late GI bleeding. Conclusions : The treatment outcome of our institution was comparable to published results of IMRT. The higher risk groups of T stage, Gleason score, initial PSA, and age of 80 or older, were significant risk factors for BFFS. Pelvic irradiation modestly increased acute GI toxicity. MRI was more accurate for BFFS prognosis. Late GI bleeding was associated with a mean dose above 48 Gy to the rectum.'},\n",

We report the treatment outcome and patterns of failure in women with operable HER2-positive breast cancer using trastuzumab as adjuvant setting at our institution, furthermore, focus on the incidence of central nervous system failure and the predictors for those with high risk of developing CNS relapse. Method and Material: We retrospectively identified 243 women with HER2-positive operable breast cancer diagnosed and treated at our institution between June 2002 and December 2011. All patients with tumor size more than two centimeters or any positive lymph node received adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab. Central nervous system failure was recognized through clinical symptoms and neuro-images during follow up. We estimated the event - free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and brain-metastasis free survival (BMFS) using Kaplan-Meier method, and performed cox-proportional hazards models to assess the impact of clinical-pathologic parameters on EFS, OS. The covariates for predicting CNS relapse either as first site or as sequential event during follow up were also analyzed. Results: With median follow up of 63.57 months (range 8.8~132.4months) of entire cohort, the five year event-free survival rate, overall survival rate, and brain-metastasis free survival was 72%, 85%, and 92%, respectively. Forty-three of sixty first events (71.7%) were distal relapse which remained the main failure type of our cohort. The five year cumulative incidence of different first events, included loco-regional recurrence, CNS relapse, distal non-CNS relapse, second primary, and non-cancer death, were 4.7%, 2.57%, 15.83%, 1.46%, and 0.4%. Central nervous system failure either as first site of recurrence or as a sequential event was noted in six and ten women. No adjuvant trastuzumab, positive lymph node number more than nine, and dermis involvement significantly predicted poorer event free survival on uni-and-multivariate analysis(p= 0.001, ＜ 0.001, 0.042, respectively). These factors also translated in predicting overall survival. No significant predictor was noted for the occurrence of CNS relapse as first site (5-year cumulative incidence: 1.86% and 3.02% in patients with or without adjuvant trastuzumab, p= 0.633). The negatively prognostic factors for brain-metastasis free survival were positive lymph node number more than nine, lymphovascular invasion, and high grade tumor (p= 0.043, ＜0.001, and ＜0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Using adjuvant trastuzumab improves event-free survival and overall survival in women with stage II /III HER2-positive breast cancer. The development of CNS relapse did not increase in our patients receiving trastuzumab based adjuvant therapy. Brain image as part of follow up might be considered, especially for those with positive lymph node number more than nine, high grade tumor, and with lymphovascular invasion. Larger prospective data or data from published randomized trials is needed for determining patients with high risks of developing CNS relapse.'},\n",

Materials and Methods: From 2009 to 2012, 6 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated for a total dose of 50 Gy in 5 fractions with SRT. All patients underwent image studies (CT or MRI) and ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity, funduscopy and ultrasound, before and regularly after treatment. In this study, three patients had medium-sized tumors (tumor height ≤ 10 mm and tumor base ≤ 16 mm) and the other three had large-sized tumors (tumor height ＞10 mm or tumor base ＞16 mm). Results: With a median follow-up duration of 29 months, the 3-year local control, distant metastasis free and overall survival were all 100%. One patient had enucleation due to the development of radiation-induced neovascular glaucoma after 25 months. In addition, one patient developed a cataract after 24 months and received an intraocular lens implant. Among the four patients with pre-treatment visual acuity ＞0.1(VA), VA was preserved in 3 patients. Conclusions: Our study supports the theory that hypofractionated SRT with 50Gy applied in five fractions seems to be sufficient to obtain good tumor control. More efforts should be made to reduce the radiation-induced neovascular glaucoma and preserve visual acuity.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Introduction: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of bladder filling on uterus-cervix mobility in patients with cervical cancer and an intact uterus treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Methods and Materials: Twenty-two consecutive women with cervical cancer (FIGO stage IB-IVB) receiving pelvic IMRT were selected for analysis. Two series of treatment planning CT scans, one with a full bladder and the other with an empty bladder, were acquired. The target volumes and normal tissues were contoured on each CT scan according to the updated guidelines and staging MRI. We determined the centroid positions of the cervical tumor and uterus, then correlated the centroid displacement to the delta volume of the bladder (DVB; defined as the volume difference between full and empty urinary bladders; the maximized bladder filling change). Results: A significant mobility of the uterus-cervix according to bladder filling was observed on the superior-inferior axis only. For all patients, displacement of the uteruscervix on the superior-inferior axis was significantly correlated with the DVB (adjusted R2= 0.49, p= 0.0005). Among 8 patients with cervical tumor invading less than onehalf of the uterus, the target displacement affected by DVB was well-described by linear regression (adjusted R2= 0.61, p= 0.0008). For those with bulky tumor extent, the correlation between target displacement and DVB was much less apparent. For patients have anteverted uterus (n= 11), the DVB was associated with cervix-uterus motion on superior-inferior axis (adjusted R2 =0.40, p= 0.022), while for those with retroverted or tip-up uterus, there was no significant correlation. After a multivariate linear regression analysis, DVB and tumor extent were significantly correlated with uterus-cervix motion. Conclusion: The maximized bladder filling change (DVB), and tumor extent, were significantly correlated with uterus-cervix centroid displacement on the superiorinferior axis of cervical cancer patients.'},\n",

The attenuation effects of CFRCB will affect the dose accuracy in radiation treatment plans. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the attenuation effects with different measurement field sizes and gantry angle due to the Carbon Fiber Respiratory Control Board. Materials and Methods: The CT numbers of CFRCB would be analyzed to predict the electron density and attenuation of each components. The attenuation factors of CFRCB were measured with rotated gantry angles in 6 MV and 10 MV using a Varian iX Linac machine. In the measurements, the CFRCB compressed from anterior (gantry= 180°) to the center of plastic water phantoms. A PTW 30013 0.6cc farmer chamber was placed in plastic water phantoms and measured with different field sizes. The attenuation factors would be calculated and compared between different field sizes and photon energy with paired t-test. The Gafchromic EBT3 films replaced the farmer chamber to perform the attenuation of the compressor in 2D. Results: In phantom attenuation measurements, there were no attenuation effects in gantry angle 300° to 60° (posterior). In gantry angle 165° to 195° (anterior), the mean attenuations were 25.17% vs 20.21% (in 6 MV vs 10 MV) in smaller field size 10 x 10 cm^2, and 23.53% vs 19.20% in larger field size. In the other gantry angles, the mean attenuations were 9.51% vs 7.31% (in 6 MV vs 10 MV) in smaller field size, and 8.57% vs 6.84% in larger field size. In larger field size and higher photon energy, the attenuation factors were significantly decrease (p＜ 0.01).The largest attenuation of the compressor was in diameter 1cm of beam center, that is the position of the screw. The attenuation due to the respiratory suppression plate was lower than the attenuation of the screw, but it should also be concerned. Conclusions: The attenuation effects were decrease when measured with higher energy, larger field size. Therefore, CFRCB can control and decrease the respiratory motions efficiently and comfortably, but the attenuation effect should be considered. When the tumor targets are blocked by CFRCB, the CFRCB should not be used in treatment or the attenuation effects must be calculated by the planning system.'},\n",

The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: Median follow-up was 13.6 months (range, 3.6-67.1 months). Median OS and time to progression for 65 patients were 13.3 and 8.2 months, respectively. Median OS of group 1, 2 and 3 were 19.9, 12.6 and 10.4 months, respectively. The group 1 had significantly better OS than both group 2 (p = 0.03) and group 3 (p = 0.04). No significant difference in OS of group 2 and 3 (p = 0.06).

Methods and Materials: A total of 20 patients diagnosed with tissue-confirmed intracranial germinoma between 2006 and 2012 and available follow-up data were included in this study. Sixteen patients underwent CRT and 4 underwent RT alone. CRT involved one to five cycles of upfront chemotherapy followed by limited-field (whole ventricle plus primary tumor boost) or extended-field RT (craniospinal irradiation [CSI] followed by limited-field), for which the RT field and dose depended on the tumor location, response to chemotherapy, and metastatic status. Among them, 13 patients received limited or extended-field RT with 3-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), and 7 patients received CSI accompanied by helical tomotherapy. Results: This study consisted of 18 male and 2 female patients, with a median age of 14 years (7-29 y). After a median follow-up of 34 months, the 3-year disease-free survival rate and overall survival (OS) rate were 90% and 100%, respectively. For the RT alone group, the CSI was delivered with a tumor dose of 30.6 Gy in fractions of 1.8 Gy/d, whole-ventricle and neurohypophysis involved administering 30 Gy in fractions of 2 Gy/d if no CSI was used. Finally, the tumor was boosted to receive a total median dose of 50 Gy (46.5-50.4 Gy), whereas for the CRT group, the entire brain and/or spine received a median of 24 Gy (21.6-30.6 Gy) in fractions of 1.5-1.8 Gy/d, and the tumor was boosted to a total median dose of 45 Gy (24-50.4 Gy). No recurrences developed in patients treated using extended RT; however, 2 patients treated with CRT, but not with CSI, developed spinal relapse.

Materials and Methods: For both IMRT and RapidArc, the dose calculations and optimizations were performed using the Eclipse treatment planning system. The plans for IMRT with nine fixed beams were compared against four partial arcs with a single isocenter. All plans were optimized for 6 MV photon beams. The dose prescription was 60 Gy to the planning target volume. For organs at risk, the mean and maximum doses were constrained and additional objectives were set on various volume thresholds. The monitor units (MUs) and delivery time were scored to measure the treatment efficiency. The treatment planning dosimetry scored delivery to the calculation agreement with the passing rate of gamma index. Results: RapidArc and IMRT provided equivalent coverage, the average of maximum dose of CTV for IMRT and RapidArc were 65.78 Gy, 67.09 Gy, respectively. The conformity index (COIN) and homogeneity index (HI) of RapidArc were better than IMRT. Both techniques accomplished objectives on organs at risk with a tendency of RA to improve sparing.

This study examines the relationship between these parameters and their influence on the quality of treatment plan. Material and Method: Target volumes and organ at risk (OAR) volumes were delineated on a computerized tomography of a cylindrical chess phantom. Maintaining the weightings of each volume, treatment plans were optimized with a different combination of planning parameters (FW = 5, 2,5, 1 cm. PF = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8). Each plan was analyzed for dose distribution, treatment time, homogeneity index, conformity index and ripple effect. Result: For revolutions lasting between 15 and 60 seconds, the increase in treatment time correlated with decreasing field width. The ratio between treatment time with different field widths, when treatment time at 5 cm was 1, 1.8 and 4 times at widths of 2.5 cm and 1 cm respectively. Where change in pitch factor was did not result in change in treatment time. For revolutions under 15 seconds, smaller pitch denotes longer treatment time. The dimension of penumbra increased with increasing width. At pitch factor 0.6, the ripple effect was evident and the homogeneity index was at its worst. Transversely, conformity indices differed non-significantly. Longitudinally, the dose gradient increased with decreasing field width. Doses to OARs were minimized at small pitch and field width. OARs in longitudinal direction had higher median dose. Conclusion: Change in field width could lead to change in treatment time. Treatment time could be shortened with combination of large field width and the pitch value, at expense of increased dose to longitudinal directions. Combination of small field width and small pitch yielded better planning quality, and increase in treatment time.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Introduction: Small cell carcinoma usually arises in the lung but can also originate in a wide range of extrapulmonary sites. Extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma is rare, encompassing approximately 0.1-0.4 percent of all small cell carcinomas, and has been described in a variety of organs. Small cell carcinoma of the genitourinary tract is often found in the urinary bladder, and is extremely rare in the ureter. Case report: A 56-year-old man was admitted with a two-month history of the right flank pain. An abdominal computed tomography demonstrated an infiltrative mass lesion with size of about 8.5 × 7.6 cm in the right pelvis, arising from the right ureter, with severe right hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine for 3 cycles, followed by right side hand-assisted retroneoscopic nephroureterectomy. Then adjuvant concurrent chemo-radiotherapy was given. The chemotherapy regimens were cisplatin and etoposide for 3 cycles. The irradiation course consisted of 64.8 Gy/36 fractions to the tumor bed. Discussion: The most common symptoms of this disease are gross hematuria and flank pain. The staging of this disease is according to small cell carcinoma of the lung. The treatment of ureter small cell carcinoma is not well established. Despite adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, most patients develop metastatic disease resulting in poor prognosis of this disease. Aggressive treatment is warranted to improve the outcome. However, the tolerance of the patients is still needed to be considered.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To report preliminary biochemical outcomes, survival and toxicity for patients with localized prostate cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).Materials and Methods: Between December 2003 and March 2012, eighty-seven patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with IMRT at our institution. Treatment was planned using an inverse-planning method. The beam intensity profiles were delivered by dynamic multileaf collimation. Patients were stratified by prognostic risk groups based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk classification criteria. Biochemical failure was defined using the 2005 ASTRO Phoenix consensus definition of the nadir prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration plus 2 ng/mL. Prescribed dose ranged from 61-78.4 Gy. The median follow-up time was 41 months (range: 10-105 months).Results : The 3-year actuarial biochemical relapse-free survival rates for low, intermediate, high, and very high risk group patients were 100%, 100%, 76.3%, and 88.5%, respectively. The 3- and 5-year actuarial overall survival rates were 92% and 80%. Twenty-five patients (28.7%) developed acute Grade 2 GI toxicity, and no patient experienced acute Grade 3 or greater rectal symptoms. Nineteen patients (21.8%) developed acute Grade 2 genitourinary (GU) symptoms, and one experienced Grade 3 or higher GU toxicity. No patient developed late Grade 2 or greater rectal toxicity. Only three patients (3.5%) experienced late Grade 2 GU toxicity. No late Grade 3 or greater GU complications have been observed.Conclusions: Our data demonstrate the feasibility of IMRT in the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Acute and late rectal toxicities are minimal. Short-term biochemical controls are comparable to published results of IMRT. Based on this favorable outcome, IMRT has become the standard treatment for localized prostate cancer at our institution.'},\n",

Body-mass factors included body weight, body height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist thickness, hip circumference and hip thickness. Setup displacements for each patient were assessed by four components: namely systemic error (SE), and random error (RE), through three translational directions and couch rotation (CR). The median values for the body-mass factors were used as cutoff points to divide the groups. The Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to assess the predictive role of these factors for the set-up errors.Results: Population SE and RE were 2.8 mm, 2.6 mm, 2.4 mm and 1.7 mm, 1.4 mm, 1.3 mm in the superior-inferior (SI), anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions, respectively. The SE and RE for rotation (CR) was 0.33 and 0.25 degree. Larger waist circumference (WC) was significantly correlated with greater SI-SE (p = 0.02), and CR-RE (p = 0.013), whereas larger hip circumference (HC) with greater SI-RE (p = 0.045), and CR-RE (p = 0.018). Higher BMI was associated with greater, CR-RE (p = 0.006). Body height correlated with AP-SE (p = 0.036).Conclusions: To reduce setup displacements in women with gynecological cancer requiring pelvic IMRT, the use of on-line IGRT should be recommended for those who have a WC ＞ 80.5 cm or a HC ＞ 88.8 cm, or a BMI ＞22.1 Kg/m^2.'},\n",

The aim of this study was to utilize the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans acquired before treatment for dose reconstruction and hereby to assess target volume coverage during prostate SBRT.Materials and Methods: Three patients with early stage prostate cancer were included in this study. All patients had implanted two golden fiducial markers under transrectal ultrasound for image-guided localization. The rectum and bladder in-house preparation protocols were used in this study. Before each treatment, the patient was first set up with a pair of orthogonal kilovoltage (kV) portal images based on fiducial markers and subsequently adjusted to the treatment position with CBCT for soft tissue alignment. A CBCT image set acquired prior to each treatment for patient positioning was employed for the dose reconstruction calculation. The prescription dose was 37.5 Gy in 5 fractions. The criterion of plan is to satisfy at least the 95% of prescription dose to cover 95% of PTV (V95 greater than 95%).Results: All the patients can meet the V95 greater than 95% criterion if we corrected the patient position base on CBCT image. There was only 86% of all fractions can meet the V95 greater than 95% when the patient position was corrected with kV portal images. For bladder, 86.66% and 60% of all fractions could meet the criteria of V50 of bladder less than 50%, and V100 less than 5 c.c respectively. For rectum, 86.66%, 94%, 60%, and 60% of all fractions could meet the criteria of V50 of rectum less than 50%, V80 less than 20%, V90 less than 10%, and V100 less than 5% respectively. Furthermore, there are less than 5cc of rectum receiving 100% of dose for all cases.Conclusion: The correct dose delivered to the correct location is the most important goal of radiation therapy especially for SBRT. The tighter margin than other conventional treatment was applied to this study. Our results show the CBCT registration provides the opportunity to improve the dose delivery accuracy. Although the dose and volume variations of bladder and rectum still cannot be controlled well even if we used in house special protocols in this study. In conclusion, the margin apply to this study is sufficient to achieve the PTV coverage if applying CBCT base on soft tissue matching for patient position registration.

       "  'e': 'Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard therapy for patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CCRT is usually associated with various levels of complications due to the dosage of either chemotherapy regimen or radiation; therefore, only patients with good performance status were qualified for this aggressive treatment. Gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is well tolerated compared with most chemotherapy regimens in treating NSCLC patients, and there is no need to decrease the dosage of gefitinib when combined with radiotherapy. Induction chemotherapy, although not recommended in the treatment strategy for patients with unresectable NSCLC, may be appropriate for select patients who are most likely to benefit from subsequent CCRT. In this case, we report on an unresectable stage IIIB NSCLC patient, who had failed to two lines of chemotherapy, received gefitinib followed by concurrent target-radiotherapy with complete remission and long-term disease free survival for 2 years. We suggest that patients with unresectable NSCLC should be initially considered to receive induction chemotherapy or target therapy and plan further treatment such as radiotherapy or surgery according to the response.'},\n",

Materials and Methods: This study included 109 patients with histologically confirmed ESCC at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between January 2007 and December 2010. The median age at diagnosis of the patients was 62 years old (range, 34-89 years). Patients who were clinically staged as T2-4, N0-1, M0-1, stage II-IV ESCC received definitive CCRT as the primary treatment, with radiotherapy at 1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction and concurrent infusional cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 1-2 cycles. Radiotherapy was delivered by three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique, with a median dose of 56 Gy (range, 45-70 Gy). The overall survival (OS) rates and local recurrence free survival (LRFS) rates were compared between high radiation dose (56-70 Gy, n= 55) group and standard radiation dose (45-55.8 Gy, n= 54) group. Survival analysis was done with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model.Results: Two-year overall survival rate of the high-dose and standard-dose group was 38.0% and 23.2%, respectively. The 2-year OS rate of stage II, III, and IV was 57.9%, 32.8%, and 20.1%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that high dose radiation (≧56 Gy), T classification, M classification, and clinical stage significantly affected overall survival (p= 0.013, 0.016, 0.012, and 0.010, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that high dose radiation ≧56 Gy (p= 0.030) and clinical stage II-III (p= 0.015) were significant predictors of better OS. In the univariate and multivariate analyses of the patients with M0 disease (n= 49), high dose radiation also has a remarkable impact on LRFS (p= 0.020, 0.003, respectively). Conclusion: Our study showed that higher radiation dose (≧56 Gy) significantly improved OS and LRFS in patients with unresectable ESCC who underwent definitive CCRT using 3DCRT or IMRT techniques. Further randomized clinical studies are required to clarify the benefits and side effects of escalated radiation dose in the setting of modern conformal radiotherapy techniques.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of applying VMAT for HNC patients in daily practice by comparing volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for patients with locally advanced head-and-neck cancer (HNC) with regard to the dosimetric parameters and efficiency of delivery.Material & Method: Nine locally advanced HNC patients on either an IMRT or VMAT treatment plan were selected for this study. Another corresponding plan using an alternative technique was generated for comparison. We applied an adaptive strategy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique in all radiation therapy protocols, including an initial plan and a reduced plan with acquisition of CT images about 4 weeks later. The Philips Pinnacle³® Planning System v. 9.0 was adopted for designing all treatment plans. Dosimetric parameters compared between VMAT and IMRT plans included target coverage, dose conformity, dose homogeneity, organs at risk (OAR) sparing, monitor units (MUs) and treatment delivery time.Result: The average number of arc used in the VMAT plan was 2.07 and the number of fields per IMRT plan was 6.5. The VMAT and IMRT plans had similar PTV coverage (V100% ＞ 98% and ＞ 96%, respectively). There was no significant difference between VMAT and IMRT in conformity (CI= 1.73 and 1.63, respectively, p= 0.546), homogeneity of PTV-H (HI= 1.08 and 1.07, respectively, p= 0.387), PTV-M (HI = 1.10 and 1.10, respectively, p= 0.891) and PTV-L (HI = 1.13 and 1.12, respectively, p= 0.369).

       "  'e': 'Purpose: Radiosurgery plays an important role in treating patients with intraocular tumor and retained visual function aiming at organ-conservation. Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKRS) provides a relatively non-invasive and less time-consuming procedure for treating patients with choroidal melanoma comparing with plaque brachytherapy. It also has the potential radiosurgery to provide effective treatment for other ophthalmologic indication. We presented a new treatment protocol using GKRS to treat patient with intraocular tumor and evaluated the safety and precision of GKRS as a primary treatment for intraocular tumor.Methods: Two patients with uveal melanoma and one patient with breast cancer orbital metastasis treated with the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion stereotactic radiosurgery in our hospital. Retrobulbar anesthesia following fixation of the treated eye by suturing two extraocular muscles to the stereotactic frame were performed in order to immobilize the eye in the whole treatment procedure. The dose to the tumor margin was 25-30 Gy prescribed at 50-55% isodose line. Contrast-enhanced MRI was used for Gamma Plan dose planning. CT scans were done after eye fixation, immediate before and after the GKRS to confirm the accuracy of tumor localization. We compared tumor volume, tumor and lens gravity point deviation, and tumor coverage in the 3 sets of CT scans to check the precision of immobilization and eye fixation.Results: The eye movement analysis revealed that the gravity point coordination deviation of the tumor and lens between CT-1 and CT-2, or CT-1 and CT-3 was less than 0.120 mm. At least 95% of the tumor volume was covered by the prescription dose in the 3 sets of CT image. After GKRS, tumor shrinkage and serous retinal detachments disappearance were noted by ophthalmoscopy and orbital MRI in two patients. No major complication was found during follow up.Conclusion: GKRS using our treatment protocol is a relatively non-invasive, organconserving, and less time-consuming single fraction treatment for intraocular tumor. Our eye fixation method reveals high accuracy. Larger study with long term follow up is needed to evaluate the dose response result of the patients.'},\n",

Plastic Water® Phantom Material (PSW), Standard Grade Solid Water® (GSW), Virtual Water^TM Phantom Materials (VSW), RW3 solid water phantom (RW3), white polystyrene phantom (Wpoly), acrylic phantom (Acry) and clear polystyrene phantom (Cpoly) are enrolled to compare the responses with water for 6, 10 and 15 MV photon beams and 6, 9, 12 and 15 MeV electron beams. For the RW3 and Wpoly, we compare the results using the water and clear polystyrene parameters for clinical absolute dosimetry calculation. Ionization measurements were taken at water equivalent depths of 5 cm and dmax for photon and electron beams, respectively. The phantom dose conversion factor (PDCF) of the absolute dose between solid water phantoms and water at the identical calibration conditions are obtained. Additionally, comparisons for percent depth doses at water equivalent depths of 5, 10, and 15 cm in photon beams, and d50 and d80 in electron beams were performed to verify the different response at different depths.Results: The variations between five solid water phantoms and water for photon beams are all within 1.0%. For PSW and Acry, the variations in electron beams are within 1.0%. However, the variations are -0.6 to -3.6% for 6 to 15 MeV electron beams for GSW, VSW, RW3, Wploy and Cpoly. The PDCF of 0.994~ 0.964 for electron beams are obtained. The variations of PDD (5 cm), PDD (10 cm), PDD (15 cm) between five solid water phantoms and water for photon beams are within 1.1%. The variations of d50 and d80 between five solid water phantoms and water for photon beams are within 1.5 mm.Conclusion: The PSW、GSW、VSW、RW3、Wpoly solid water phantom can be treated as water for 6, 10 and 15 MV photon beams. And the PSW can also be treated as water for electron beams. For electron beam dose calibration, PDCF should be applied for GSW, VSW, RW3 and Wpoly. Phantom response relative to water should be evaluated carefully when TG-21 protocol is used for clinical dose calibration.'},\n",

The differences between three methods were decreased with large radial distances.Conclusion: The variation between the result of measurement and calculation with TG-43 were within 8%. The underestimate of dose for Sievert integral might be due to the oblique scatting, and the influence of oblique scatting would be decreased with the increasing of radial distance. The most contribution of error in this study might be come from the shift of TLD positions and the brachytherapy source position.'},\n",

The number of intrathocic lesions was ≦ 5 and none of them exceeded 5 cm in greatest dimension. Overall survival, rate of in-field recurrence and incidence of radiation pneumonitis were analyzed. Megavoltage computerized tomography (MVCT) was utilized for tumor contouring. The mean radiation dose per fraction was 4.7±0.3 Gy (mean±standard deviation) and the number of fractions ranged between 9 and 16 (median: 10 fractions). Total irradiation dose was 48.8±6.8 Gy.Results: The median follow-up period was 16.1 months. There was no in-field failure. The median duration of overall survival was 11.2 months among patients with extrapulmonary disease (EPD) and 38.6 months among patients without EPD (p = 0.03). The median duration of overall survival was 34.7 months among patients with ＜ 3 intrathoracic GTV s and 32.1 months among patients with 3-5 intrathoracic GTVs (p = 0.57). The aggregated intrathoracic GTV in each patient averaged 39.18±39.98 cm3. The median duration of overall survival was 38.6 months among patients with aggregated intrathoracic GTV ≦27.89 cm^3 and 12.3 months among patients with aggregated intrathothoracic GTV ＞ 27.89 cm^3 (p= 0.04). Two patients developed grade 3 or greater radiation pneumomhs.Conclusion: HT may be feasible for selected stage IV NSCLC patients with the number of intrathoracic lesions less than or equal to 5. Excellent local control can be anticipated. Presence of EPD and volume of intrathoracic lesions may be significant prognostic factors for overall survival.'},\n",

It causes the higher dose at the first segment and lower dose at the last segment. The purposes are that exam the dosimetric accuracy with overshoot effect, and improve the accuracy with corrections.Materials and Method's: There are two parts in the study. The first part is to exam the overshoot with the dose rates, from 100 MU/min to 600 MU/min, and segment dose, from 1 MU per segment (MUI seg) to 10 MU/seg. The second part is to correct and measure the overshoot effect with block correct, interlace correct and index correct.Result : The overshoot effect cause higher dose at the first segment and lower dose at the last segment with higher dose rate and lower dose per segment. While the dose per segment is 1 MU and the dose rate is 600 MU/min, the dosimetric error is up to 52.5%. The three corrections improved dosimetric accuracy with the overshoot effect. Block correct, interlace correct and index correct reduce the dose from 152.5% to 98.7%, 93.4% and 100.1 %, repectively.Conclusion: Clinically, it is possible to reduce the overshoot effect with with lower dose per segment and higher dose rate.

We analyze the outcomes and prognostic factors of patients with advanced thymic carcinoma treated at a single institution.Materials and Methods: The records of 18 patients with histologically confirmed thymic carcinoma treated between April 1996 and April 2012 at Tri-Service General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical resection was performed in 9 patients, including 3 patients who received preoperative therapy and postoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, 5 who received postoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by chemotherapy and 1 who received postoperative radiotherapy alone. Eight patients had tumor which were unresectable or medically inoperable and underwent chemoradiotherapy followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone. One patient died 2 months after diagnosis without any cancer treatment. Radiotherapy was delivered with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy using Cyberknife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The median dose of radiotherapy was 63 Gy. Most (93.3%) of the chemotherapy regimen contained cisplatin.Results: The distribution of Masaoka stage at presentation was III in 7 patients, IVA in 4 patients and IVB in 7 patients.

One limitation of the PTW 2D-ARRAY is the significant angular dependency, so we had measured the correction factors for VMAT plans. Another dosimetry system consists of a farmer type ion chamber (Wellhofer FC-65P) and solid water phantom was used to measure the selected point dose. Total of 19 IMRT and 8 VMAT plans were included in this study. IMRT plans were verified with perpendicular deliveries at 0 degree gantry angle. VMAT plans were measured with actual treatment arcs, and then the corrections were applied after the measurements. We performed gamma comparison with 3% and 3mm criteria to evaluate the results of all 2D dose maps.Results: The significant angular dependences of PTW 2D-ARRAY were showed at the measured gantry angle between 90 to 270 degrees, especially at both 90 and 270 degrees, which was parallel with the measured plane of PTW 2D-ARRAY. The gamma factors of the gantry angle 90 and 270 were 13.1% and 22.3% for 6 MV photon beam and 31.7% and 37.2% for 10 MV photon beam.The mean point doses variation between each measurements and treatment plans in all IMRT/VMAT QA was -1.0% +/-1.0 % (mean +/- std). The mean gamma factor of IMRT QA was 98.3%+/- 2.1%. And the mean gamma factor in the full-arc VMAT QA was 95.6+/-2.6% after applied acorrection factor range from 1.007 to 1.040. Therefore, the 2D dose maps showed great agreements in all IMRT/VMAT QA.Conclusions: PTW 2D-ARRAY has better performance in static angle IMRT, but has limitations caused by angular dependences in VMAT QA. We suggest a correction factor should be applied to every measured points of 2D dose maps when using PTW 2D-ARRAY for a full-arc VMAT QA.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: Verification of dose distributions for RapidArc Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) treatment plans with Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) and its associated software.Materials and Methods: Epiqa is software to covert the EPID images into dose map based on the GLAaS theory. It can be used to verify the dose distributions for RapidArc therapy. To convert images into dose map, we need to have calibration factors for each pixel to covert the pixel values into dmax dose in water. For the purpose of calibration, a set of integrated images for open and transmission fields of different field sizes are acquired and consequently imported into Epiqa together with the output factor table to establish basic algorithm configuration data. A calibration factor can then be determined for every pixel of EPID images by weighting the contribution of primary and transmitted radiation. The pixel based calibration relates the readout of a pixel to a dose at the depth of dmax in water equivalent homogenous medium. By applying the conversion factors to all pixels of the EPID images, a planar dose distribution at the dmax in water is obtained. A total of 20 patients (70 arcs in total) were included in this study, 7 with prostate cancers, 2 with breast cancer, 4 with rectal cancer, 4 with NPC, and 4 with other sites.Results : The Distance to Agreement (DTA) and the Dose Difference (ΔD) for The Gamma Agreement Index (GAI) of dosimetry parameters with EPID were set as 3 mm and less than 3% respectively. The average GAI (%) of patients in our study is 94.32 ± 3.19 (99.06-81.31). GAI (%) for prostate cancer, breast cancer, rectal cancer, NPC, and other sites is 93.62 ± 4.03 (99.06-81.31), 97.43 ± 1.14 (98.86-96.24), 92.96 ± 2.51 (97.19-89.01), 94.98 ± 2.31 (97.64-89.09), and 94.95 ± 2.48 (98.9-90.76), respectively. The GAI (%) for breast cancer had a better result, with a lowest value of 96.24. For one of the prostate cancer patient treated with 3 arcs, there are two arcs had a GAI value below 90%.Conclusions: It is an easy and feasible way to apply the EPID with Epiqa software as dosimetry verification tool for VMAT.

The purpose of this study is to survey the opinion and demand of referred patients and their family member to this service mode, and to provide a reference for future quality improvement.Material and Method: Between December 2010 and January 2012, there were 65 patients referred to the regional teaching hospital for radiotherapy. A self-constructed structural questionnaire was designed according to the characteristic of outpatient at department of radiation oncology. Statistical analysis was performed to investigate the consideration and satisfaction with this referral mode.Results : When patient considering to accept trans-hospital referral or not, the most critical factor in decision making was fear of being delayed or the anxiety associated with waiting (56.9%), the second was the confidence in the same health care system (23%), and the third was the convenience in transportation and parking (20.1%). The service patients most satisfied with were the exclusively reserved daily treatment schedule (55.4%), and the free transportation shuttle to and fro the medical center and regional hospital. In general, most patients (89.2%) acknowledged this referral mode and the service quality of this regional hospital.Conclusion: Cancer is a serious disease, and both patients themselves and hospital hope to complete the treatment as soon as possible. In circumstances when medical resources can not meet the needs and referral are suggested, hospital must provide proper arrangement. In spite of transportation across district, referral within the same health care system has advantages in ensuring the execution and consistency of cancer treatment. The considerations and opinions to this referral mode can provide useful reference for medical business management and health policy making.'},\n",

This study was aimed to investigate this association and also determine whether pretreatment body mass index (BMI) affects the association between weight loss and overall survival.Methods: 1583 NPC patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2007 undergoing definitive RT were consecutively enrolled. Survival analyses were performed with stratification according to weight change (≧5% vs.＜5%) and pretreatment BMI (≧25 vs.＜25) respectively. Cox proportional hazards model was carried out to evaluate the impact of weight change, pretreatment BMI on survival controlling for the other clinically relevant factors.Results: Weight change (≧5%) during RT is significantly influenced by age, chemotherapy, RT duration and pretreatment BMI. A statistically significant association between the status of weight change and overall survival could be identified both in univariate and multivariate analyses. After further stratification by BMI (≧25 or＜25), there is a significantly positive impact of weight loss≧5% on survival particularly among the patients who are overweight or obese (p=0.046, log-rank test).Conclusions: A weight loss≧5% during RT confers a more favorable overall survival in NPC patients who are initially overweight or obese (BMI≧25). The explanation for this phenomenon warrants further analyses with regard to locoregional control and underlying biological mechanisms.\"},\n",

       "  'e': \"Purpose: The early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of tremendous importance to prevent this devastating and frequently reported cancer. Therefore, it is required to identify novel and specific HCC diagnostic marker(s) to distinguish HCC patients from non-HCC patients at the early stage of HCC development. We employed surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) to analyze protein profiles in the serum of Taiwanese HCC and healthy, non-HCC subjects.Materials and Methods: The SELDI-Chip-System was used to determine a specific protein pattern in serum samples obtained from Taiwanese HCC and non-HCC subjects. The initial training group consisted of 63 subjects from whom serum was collected at the Yuan's General Hospital (Taiwan). To validate a potential marker pattern, a second group of 63 Taiwanese subjects was enrolled from whom serum samples were also collected, randomized, and used in a blind validation study. Serum was applied to Ciphergen ProteinChip® SAX2 Arrays and proteins bound to the chips were analyzed using the ProteinChip Reader Model PBS II. After reading the chips, all profiles of normal and tumor serum were summarized using the Biomarker pattern software to a master pattern followed by analyses using a clustering method and data mining.Results: By recruiting two groups of 63 subjects for training and validation, we identified a biomarker pattern that contained four serum protein markers with m/z of 4091, 5637, 6840, and 8567. This study allowed setting up an artificial network with high specificity and sensitivity for HCC detection. In other words, the identified biomarker pattern was used to classify serum samples of HCC and non-HCC validation group subjects. During the latter experiment, it appeared that the sensitivity and specificity of the pattern was 93.33% and 93.93%, respectively. The specimens were used to analyze and develop a classification scoring system.Conclusions: For the first time, SELDI-TOF-MS combined with a simple scoring system were employed to identify a specific biomarker pattern that allowed to efficiently and significantly distinguish Taiwanese HCC patients from non-HCC patients.\"},\n",

The number of patients with initial presentation of N1, N2a, N2b and N3 was, 1 (7%), 3 (21%), 6 (43%) and 4 (29%), respectively. Twelve patients (86%) received neck dissections and two had excision biopsies only. Five patients (36%) had metastatic nodes involving both upper and lower neck, where 9 (64%) had nodes limited to the upper neck only. Five (36%) patients presented with extracapsular spread (ECS). Patients undergoing neck dissection were treated with a median dose of 66 Gy to the ECS surgical bed. Those who did not undergo neck dissection were given 60 Gy. For those who had only excision biopsy, 70 Gy was prescribed to the tumor bed and suspected Iymphadenopathy. For all patients, a median dose of 59.4 Gy and 50 Gy was given to the pharyngeal mucosa and uninvolved lower neck, respectively. The irradiated pharyngeal mucosa, included the nasopharynx, oropharynx, surpaglottis and upper hypopharynx, but spared the vocal cords and lower hypopharynx.Results: After a median follow up of 36.4 months, four patients (21%) developed distant metastases and died, yielding a 3-year overall survival rate of 79%. There was no occurrence of the occult primary and no local regional recurrence noted. The control rate was 100%. Two patients had second primary tumors noted over the cervical esophagus and the buccal mucosa. In subgroup analysis, patients with clinical N3 stage, with nodal involvement over the lower neck region and nodes possessing ECS had significantly poorer overall survival and poor distant metastases-free survival rates. In patients with cN2 or cN3 disease, those receiving excision biopsy had a poor overall survival (p=0.001) and distant metastases-free survival (p=0.029) compared to those undergoing neck dissection. There was no grade III chronic toxicity during follow-up.Conclusions: In our experience, IMRT with vocal cords and lower hypopharyngeal sparing can achieve excellent functional outcomes without compromising disease control and may be adopted as a safe and effective treatment for SCCHN of UPS Patients with clinical N3 stage, lower neck involvement and nodes with ECS have significantly poorer overall survival and distant metastases-free survival rates. More intense regimens should be developed for such patients.'},\n",

Follow-up time ranged from 5-25 months (median: 17 mo.). Four patients had a solitary lesion and 3 had small multiple lesions (Iess than 3 nodules), the maximum tumor diameter ranged from 1.5 cm. to 5 cm. Primary tumor sites were rectal cancer (n=2), lung Cancer (n=2), pancreatic cancer (n=1), renal cell cancer (n=1), bladder cancer (n=1). The ages ranged from 60-87 years old. The patients were treated with 60 Gy delivered in 3 fractions given every other day. Isodose value range from 75-80% of the prescribed dose.Results: A follow-up CT-scan of the abdomen done 3 months after Cyberknife image-guided robotic stereotactic radiosurgery showed complete response was attained in 3 patients and partial response in 4 patients. Six months after the treatment all patients achieved a complete tumor response. Only 1 patient shown grade 1 acute liver and gastrointestinal toxicity.

       "  'e': 'Introduction: In recent years, the dose perturbation caused by the Henschke applicator is a major concern in brachytherapy planning system (BPS). To investigate impact of the dose where there is a lack of metal shielding, Monte Carlo simulations, and BPS calculations have been performed for dose assessments in a Plastic Water® phantom.Material and Methods : A Henschke applicator consists of one tandem and two ovoids. In this study, an 192 Ir source would be driven into all three channels of a Henschke applicator, at the middle of each ovoid, and at the center of two ovoids. For BPS, the origin of the coordinates was set at the middle of two ovoids, as was the Monte Carlo simulation. The dose normalization point was the average dose at six arbitrary points extended to the surface of the ovoids by 5 mm. Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code MCNP (X-5 Monte Carlo Team) was used in this study to simulate the dose distribution and output simulation data was recorded by mesh tally. The Monte Carlo set-up parameters had been validated by TG-43 data in a previous report.Results: The isodose distribution with Henschke applicator and without Henschke applicator showed tremendous deviation between Monte Carlo simulation and BPS calculation. This indicated that a Henschke applicator affected the isodose distribution significantly. Compared to the prescription dose area, the simulation isodose curves had a shrinkage of about 0.5 cm, when the metal applicator was considered.Conclusions: The Henschke applicator affected the dose distribution significantly and this could be observed in Monte Carlo simulation, but not in BPS.'},\n",

In univariate analysis, poor Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (≤ 70, P = 0.036), multiple neurologic deficits (p = 0.044), multiple brain lesions or corpus callosum invasion (p = 0.003) , subtotal resection (p = 0.001) , no RT (p ＜ 0.001) , and no temozolomide (p = 0.001) were significant prognostic factors for predicting poor OS of these patients. In multivariate analysis, multiple neurologic deficits (p = 0.008), multiple brain lesions or corpus callosum invasion (p = 0.007), subtotal resection (p = 0.005), no RT (p ＜ 0.001), and no temozolomide (p = 0.007) remained independent worse prognostic factors for OS 01 these patients.Conclusion: Our results indicated that multiple neurologic deficits, image findings of corpus callosum invasion or multiple brain lesions, and single modality treatment were important factors for predicting poor prognosis.'},\n",

They were treated in the Radiation Oncology Department of the Tri-Service General Hospital from March 2007 to March 2009. The median follow-up time for all patients was 12 months (range 2 to 36 months). Overall survival was the primary end point.Results: For the 3D-CRT and SBRT patient groups, the median survival (MS) was 11 months and 16 months with the 1-year overall survival (OS) of 42.9% and 70.0%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, CyberKnife SBRT (p= 0.019), non-advanced Okuda stage (p= 0.002), serum albumin higher than 3.5g /dl (p= 0.008), and total bilirubin lower than 2.0 mg/dL (p= 0.042) were associated with significantly better OS. Further statistical analyses showed that those patients in Child-Pugh class A who received SBRT had better OS than those who received 3D-CRT (p= 0.047). Multivariate analyses revealed that Okuda stage (p= 0.006). Child-Pugh class (p= 0.042) and technique of RT (p= 0.029) were significant prognostic factors for OS.Conclusions: This study showed that patients who received SBRT had significantly better OS than those who received 3D-CRT. SBRT has the advantage of short overall treatment times compared to 3D-CRT. Our results also suggest that SBRT could be considered first in patients with Child-Pugh class A.

A synchronous malignancy was defined as a second malignancy diagnosed within 6 months after the initial diagnosis of cancer. A metachronous malignancy was defined as a second malignancy diagnosed more than 6 months after the initial diagnosis of cancer. For the treatment of esophageal cancer, 11 patients underwent surgery with or without neoadjuvant concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT), and the other 22 patients received definitive radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy. For the treatment of H&N cancer, 15 patients underwent surgical intervention with or without adjuvant CCRT, and the other 18 patients received definitive CCRT.Result: Our study included 33 patients. Among these patients, 10 presented with synchronous H&N and esophageal cancer, and 23 patients developed metachronous carcinomas. The median age at primary diagnosis was 56.8 years (range: 40.7-79.6 years). The median follow-up time for living patients was 41 .3 months. For the entire group, the median overall survival time (OS) and disease-free survival time (DFS) were 13.6 and 9.3 months, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that T stage of esophageal cancer (T1/T2 vs. T3/T4) was a significant prognostic factor for OS and DFS (22.5 vs.12.2 months [p=0.041], and 21.3 vs. 8.5 months [p = 0.020], respectively). In the case of synchronous or metachronous esophageal cancer, surgical intervention was associated with a better outcome than radiotherapy, with borderline significance (p = 0.076).Conclusions: Patients with synchronous or metachronous H&N and esophageal cancer had poor outcomes. Those with T1/T2 esophageal cancer had a better chance for survival than those with T3/T4 esophageal cancer. This result implies that the T stage of esophageal cancer is a prognosis-limiting factor. Routine screening for synchronous or metachronous esophageal cancer may facilitate early detection and thereby improve the outcomes.'},\n",

A commercial Elekta Synergy linear accelerator and SmartArc algorithm in Pinnacle^3 9.0 was used. The patients were treated clinically with VMAT using 3° gantry spacing and reoptimized using 2°, 4° and 6°. An 8 mm thick water equivalent contour couch was added under the phantom.

These 66 patients were divided into two groups. Group A (n = 37) were those with a neck to couch perpendicular distance (NCD) ＜ 3 cm, measuring at the point just caudal to the hollow-pillow, and the γ did not use the NSS for neck support Group S (n = 29) were those with NCD equal to or larger than 3 cm, and all of them used NSB during RT. Another cohort of 31 cases treated in the year 2007, not using the NSB was used as the retrospective control group. Among these 31 cases, fifteen have NCD ＜ 3 cm (Group A') and sixteen cases were 3 cm (Group B'). Patient's cervical spine curvature was quantified by his/her second and fifth cervical vertebrae intersecting angle (cervical spine angle, CSA). It was measured weekly from patient's portal images and simulation films. A small difference between the weekly CSA indicated good setup accuracy. Body weight change, surgery prior to RT, NCD, and whether using a NSB or not were investigated correlating to CSA. Analyses were performed using the Pearson correlation coefficient and SPSS17 for independent univariate t test.Results: A total of 582 portal images were obtained. Patients with NCD ＜ 3 cm and not using the NSB have a CSA weekly difference of 0.67±2.58° for Group A, and 1.03±3.48° for Group A' (p = 0.484). Those with NCD ≥3 cm, CSA weekly variation for Group B was 0.41±0.66°, and was 1.52±3.63° for Group B', (p = 0.046). Surgery prior to RT significantly increased the CSA range of difference (p = 0.0436). Body weight change had little to no correlation with CSA variation (r range: 0.01 to -0.21).Conclusions: Our results indicated using NSS in patients with NCD ≥3 cm significantly reduced CSA variation among RT fractionations, thus improved setup accuracy.

Materails and Methods: From August 2007 to April 2009, one hundred and fifty hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated by radiotherapy at a teaching hospital in central Taiwan were enrolled in this study. Nutritional status and QoL of the patients were assessed by means of the Mini-Nutrition Assessment (MNA) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core-3D (EORTC QLQ-C30) at three different time points: before treatment, end of treatment, and 1 month after treatment.  Results: Forty-two percent patients had the problem of nutritional status before radiotherapy. There was no significant changes in nutritional status of the patient s who received radiotheray (Friedman X^2 = 2.06, p = 0.358). The nutritional status correlated with global health status, all five functioning scales and the most of symptom scales /item at all of the different time points. Using generalized estimating equation, global health status (p ＜ 0.01), global functioning status (p ＜ 0.05), the most severe symptoms included fatigue (p ＜ 0.05), financial difficulty (p ＜ 0.001 ), and pain ( p ＜ 0.01) were significantly improved after radiotherapy. The nutritional status o f the patients were strong relationship with global health status (p ＜ 0.001), global functioning status (p ＜ 0.001), insomnia (p ＜ 0.01), fatigue (p ＜ 0.001), financial difficulty (p ＜ 0.001), loss of appetite (p ＜ 0.001) and pain (p ＜ 0.01). Conclusion: Although the level o f nutritional status of the patients is not effectively increase in a short period, it would be worth to note that the QoL and the most of the major symptoms are significantly improved after the patient s received radiotherapy. Considering, the nutritional status of the patients will directly influence their QoL and the major symptoms.

Computed tomography (CT) scans with 10mm slice thickness were acquired for both the 3D CRT and Tomo plans. The prescribed dosage of the planning target volume (PTV) was 32 Gy. Dose homogeneity index (DHI), conformal index (CI), and physical parameters were used to compare the differences between the two treatment modalities. Results: The V95% (volume of receiving at least 95% of prescribed dose) of planning target volume-brain (PTV-B) was 100% for six plans.

We analyze the prognostic factors affecting their outcomes.Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 106 patients with FIGO stage III-IVa carcinoma of the cervix treated with CCRT between January 1999 and December 2008 in our institution. Ninety-three patients with squamous cell carcinoma (87.7%). Survival estimations were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis was performed using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.Results: The median age at diagnosis was 55 years (range: 34-86 years). The median follow-up period was 57.05 months (range: 4.57-137.3 months) respectively. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 63.4%, and 5-year local control (LC) and distant control (DC) rates of 61.3% and 57.0%, respectively. Thirty-four of 93 patients (36.6%) were diagnosed with recurrence or distant metastasis at the follow-up time. Twenty-five patients (26.8%) had distant failure, of which 24 had only distant metastasis, one patient had both distant and loco-regional recurrence, and the remaining 9 patients recurred locoregionally.ECOG performance status, tumor size, pelvic lymphadenopathy, pre-treatment hemoglobin and elevated serum SCC level after CCRT were significantly correlated with 5-year OS, LC and DC by univariate analysis. The ECOG performance status and elevated serum SCC after CCRT are significant prognostic factors for 5-year OS and LC rate. The performance status, tumor size (＞4 cm) and elevated serum SCC level after CCRT were significant for 5-year DC rate by multivariate analysis.Conclusions: The patient with poor ECOG performance status, bulky tumor (＞4cm) and elevated serum SCC after CCRT had worse outcome. More aggressive treatment may be considered for these patients.[Therapeut Radiol Oncol 2011; 18(4): 275-286]'},\n",

To aid a precise delineation for vaginal lumen, we developed a novel vagina enhancement modality (VEM) and evaluated its feasibility as well as dosimetric impact.Materials and Methods: Postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan simulations with and without VEM were taken for 5 patients with cervical or endometrial carcinoma. For the plans with VEM, cervical clip markers and a jelly-based vaginal contrast were applied before CT-simulations. The clinical target volume (CTV) of paravaginal area below the parametrium was then delineated with a 0.5-cm margin around the visible vaginal lumen. As for the plans without VEM, we applied cervical clip markers only, and the paravaginal CTV was delineated as the interspace between bladder and rectum. The feasibility of VEM was evaluated based on the visualization rate. The difference of vaginal volume contoured was also analyzed. Dosimetric parameters including mean dose and dose-volume histograms were compared between plans with and without VEM.Result: We found that the vaginal lumen was successfully illustrated on CT-simulations with VEM. In RT plans with VEM, dosimetric analysis showed significant decrease in vagina volume, bladder V45, corresponding bladder V45 and V50. The mean dose of vagina and corresponding bladder, which are critically influenced by paravaginal contouring, also showed significant reduction with VEM.Conclusion: The novel vaginal enhancement modality is an effective guide to clearly define the vagina lumen in postoperative female pelvis IMRT with dosimetric improvements particularly in bladder and vagina.[Therapeut Radiol Oncol 2011; 18(4): 311-319]'},\n",

Within the framework of Cox regression models, multivariate analysis was performed to differentiate the relationships between variables and their relevance to the survival.Results: No patient was lost to follow-up. Median survival was 13 months (range, 1-158 months). Two patients had complete response after radiotherapy. Twenty-two had partial response. The other 24 had stable disease or progression. The hyperfractionated radiotherapy group didn't show any benefit on survival (13 vs. 16.733 months, p=0.439). Age older than 50 years showed worse prognosis in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Tumor involvement more than one lobe, grossly total resection not achieved, and biologically equivalent dose (assuming α/β ratio=10) (BED10) less than 72 GyE had trends associating with worse prognosis, which were not statistically significant.Conclusion: In our study, patients didn't benefit from hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Due to small patient number, further investigation is warranted to evaluate the benefit and toxicity of hyperfractionated radiotherapy.\"},\n",

Two groups were defined: the group A (induction chemotherapy plus CCRT, n=22) and the group B (RT alone, n=22). Patients in the group B were 1:1 match-paired to those in the group A by using three factors: cancer subsite, gender, and clinical stage. Totally, there were 36 males and 8 females, with a median age of 76 years (range, 70-88 years). Patient survival and cancer control were defined as study end points.Background: This study intended to compare treatment results between induction chemotherapy plus chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and radiotherapy (RT) alone in elderly oropharynx-hypopharynx carcinoma patients who were treated curatively and non-surgically.Results: The median follow-up time for all patients was 35.0 months (range, 1-72 months). At 3 years, the group A demonstrated better cancer controls than the group B, in terms of locoregional control (86.4% versus 36.4%, p=0.002) and disease-free survival (61.4% versus 36.4%, p=0.035). However, no statistically significant differences were found on disease-specific and overall survivals. Not surprisingly, more treatment-related toxicity were observed in the group A than in the group B (grade 3-4 mucositis, 63.6% versus 27.3%, p=0.015).Conclusions: For elderly oropharynx-hypopharynx carcinoma patients treated nonsurgically, induction chemotherapy plus CCRT significantly improves cancer control when compared with RT alone. RT alone should be reserved for patients who are medically contra-indicated to chemotherapy.'},\n",

All patients received 1.8 Gy daily up to a median total dose 01 70.2 Gy to gross tumors and metastatic Iymph nodes, whereas the area harboring microscopic disease was prescribed with a median dose of 50.4 Gy. Twenty-four patients had concurrent chemotherapy. The regimen consisted of cisplatin (80-100 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 22, 43). Primary tumor volume measurement was derived using separate simulation images for the pretreatment gross tumor volume (pGTV) and the interval gross tumor volume (iGTV).Results: With a median follow-up duration of 18 months, 24 patients (68.5%) were found to have locoregional failures.

The variables, such as gender, age of diagnosis of bone metastasis, Pugh's modification of Child's grading of cirrhosis Okuda staging system, performance status, serum level of α-fetoprotein at diagnosis of bone metastasis from HCC, methods of treatment for bone metastasis, site of bone metastasis and metastasis to organ other than bones were analyzed about their influence upon prognosis.Results: Fifty-two patients (75.4%) are male and 17 patients (24.6%) are female. The medium age of diagnosis of bone metastasis was 66 years old (range from 31 to 78 years old). The medium survival from diagnosis of bone metastasis was 3.06 months. The 6-month, 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates were 30.43%, 11.59% and 5.80%, respectively. In univariate analysis, Child's grading of cirrhosis (p=0.0022), Okuda staging system (p=0.0002), and performance status (p=0.0277) were statistically significant factors for survival.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with primary and metastatic lung tumors treated by CyberKnife(superscript ®) (CK) stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).Methods: Between November 2005 and June 2008, we treated 19 patients with SBRT at Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital. The SBRT was delivered by CK tumor tracking system. Tumor response and treatment-related toxicity were evaluated by follow-up image study. Treatment-related toxicities were scored by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. In this study, we reviewed their medical records retrospectively.Results: We treated 47 lung tumors in 19 patients using CK SBRT. Eleven tumors in 8 patients were primary lung cancer, and 36 tumors in 11 patients were metastatic lung cancer. The locations of 9 tumors were central, whereas the others were peripheral. The tumor volumes were ranged from 1.1 to 110.5 ml (median, 9.5 ml). The radiation doses were ranged from 22 to 60 Gy, given in 2 to 4 fractions. The prescribed doses were normalized at 76% to 85% of the planned isodose. With a median follow-up interval of 12 months, we observed that grade 2 radiation pneumonitis (RP) occurred in 3 patients (1 central; 2 peripheral), whereas we found that grade 3 RP occurred in 2 patients with central lesions. According to the univariate analysis, female (p=0.038) and central lesion (p=0.042) were two predictive factors to the occurrence of grade≥2 RP. One grade 4 tracheal complication (tracheoesophageal fistula) and one grade 5 bronchial complication (bronchial necrosis) were observed in two patients who had centrally located recurrent tumors and had been previous treated with external beam radiotherapy. Four of the evaluable patients (16 patients) had responded completely (25%), seven exhibited partial response to treatment (43.8%), and two had stable disease (12.5%). Three patients had tumor progression after SBRT (18.7%). The 1-year overall survival (OS) was 63%, and the 1-year local progression-free survival (PFS) was 84.2%. The 1-year local PFS was 87.5% for primary lung cancer and 81.8% for metastatic lung cancer (p=0.87). The 1-year local PFS for central and peripheral lesions was 80% and 85.7%, respectively (p=0.63).Conclusion: Our study showed that SBRT using the CK system was effective for treating primary and metastatic lung tumors, providing better local control and shorter treatment course compared with those treated with conventional fractionated radiotherapy. Our study also showed two predicting factors for RP. Finally, using SBRT to treat centrally located tumor or re-irradiate recurrent tumor require additional caution due to higher risk of having complication. Thus, we suggest that more studies are needed in the future to confirm those findings in this study.'},\n",

We studied the feasibility of sparing the obturator nerves in patients receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by delineating the obturator nerves in obturator canals near to the high dose region in pelvis irradiation.Materials and Methods: Volumetric computed tomography (CT) images of ten patients with cervical cancers were retrieved. Anatomical orientation of obturator canals were gathered based on published knowledge in textbooks. Target volume of obturator nerves and pertinent normal structures were contoured and reconstructed for IMRT planning. Dosimetric parameters including dose-volume histograms (DVHs), maximal dose, prescription dose coverage and conformal index were compared between plans with and without obturator nerves as organ of avoidance.Result: A guideline for delineation of obturator canals for IMRT on axial contrast CT images was derived. The use of sparing the obturator nerve technique resulted in an average of 18.3±4.1 % decrease in the calculated maximum dose of the obturator nerves (p＜0.05). No significant impact on the conformality and coverage of planning target volume (PTV) of cervical cancer and neither significant dosimetric impact on other critical normal organs in pelvic area.Conclusion: We found that sparing the obturator nerve technique is feasible for patients with cervical cancer and treated with IMRT. The reduction of doses to OBN did not compromise target coverage of tumor and DVHs of other normal organs.'},\n",

We also designed two experiments with phantom moved in different phases and frequency of the respiratory cycle to test for the accuracy of the image guide system on motion compensation. The clinical dosimetry verification studies included the lung, liver and prostate cancer patients. The two dimensional dose distribution (sagittal and axial) measured by the MD-55 film was compared with the treatment planning result by a gamma comparison with pass criteria of 3%/3 mm.\\nResult: The average positional error for the static stage study was 0.42±0.06 mm. The average targeting error with and without the SRTS tracking compensation in the respiratory cycle was 0.35±0.10 mm and 7.59±5.14 mm, respectively (p＜0.0001). The difference of average targeting error between two respiratory cycles (15/min and 20/min) was 0.12 mm (p=0.11). In the verification of the axial and sagittal 2-D dose distribution of the three clinical cases, they were 99% compatible. Conclusion: The spatial positional error of SRTS was less than 0.5 mm which matched the accuracy requirement of stereotatic radiosurgery. By using the SRTS to track and compensate for the motion of lesions during respiratory cycle, we can significantly minimize the volume of the treatment field and the dose of the surrounding critical structures. The accuracy of dosimetry was also proven by our clinical cases experiments. However, additional positional error will be caused by patient who can not tolerate to the long treatment hours (1.5 to 2.5 hrs).'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: Position Emission Tomography (PET) is a non-invasive technique used in nuclear medicine, which provides physiological information using molecular tracers. As 3D PET data acquisition increases, random and scatter coincidence events increase relevantly. They cause a uniform distribution of background on the image and degrade the accuracy of quantitative analysis. The conventional corrections for random and scatter coincidences are achieved by the delayed window technique and Single Scatter Simulation (SSS) method. However, they increase noise and reduce image accuracy.\\nMaterial and Methods: The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of using a beam stopper (BS) for correcting non-true coincidence events. The BS placed on the line of response (LOR) at two different locations rotating with constant degrees absorbs a particular fraction of the true events. The non-true coincidence, non-blocked at the LORs by each stopper, can be estimated. Assuming that the non-true radiation is a spatially slow-varying distribution, the whole non-true sinogram can be recovered using cubic-spline interpolation from these local measurements. Beam stopper rotated (BSR) reduces the effective sampling distance without increasing the number of the stoppers. In this study, we performed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for 3-D PET with the GATE software for a cold phantom to conduct the BSR method.\\nResult: The estimate of non-true event fraction in a large FOV using BSR method is 31.55% and is close to the result of Monte-Carlo simulation. The activity ratio of region approaches the initial input quantity.\\nConclusion: We conclude that the proposed correction method is effective and better than conventional correction schemes without increasing scan time. In sum, the BSR method is a convenient and effective correction for non-true coincidences in 3D PET.'},\n",

Only seven eligible patients with rare malignancies of the nasopharynx were found. We retrospectively reviewed hospital charts, radiotherapy records, and imaging studies. The clinical courses and final outcomes were analyzed. Survival was compared with another group of patients with stage II-IVb conventional nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). treated by concomitant chemoradiotherapy.\\nResults: The incidence of rare nasopharyngeal malignancies was only 0.33%. The pathologic diagnoses were three rare carcinomas (adenocarcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma), three lymphomas and one rhabdomyosarcoma. The initial manifestations were similar to conventional NPC. Two patients were misdiagnosed with conventional NPC (undifferentiated carcinoma), but this was revised to rhabdomyosarcoma and malignant lymphoma when distant sites relapsed.

The beam profile was measured both with films placed on the spoiler screen and with ion chamber in a polystyrene phantom. For dose verification, TLDs were placed at twelve different sites on the patient skin during TBI treatment.\\nResults: The output ratio was 0.0466, very close to that obtained under calibration conditions after applying the inverse square correction and output factor correction for TBI treatment conditions. The tray factor, spoiler factor and the combined tray-and- spoiler factor were 0.949, 0.982 and 0.931, respectively. The discrepancy between PDD and TMR was lower than 2 %. The compensator factor was 0.045 for polystyrene thickness up to 13 cm and the thickness ratio of polystyrene to lead was 0.511.

Due to the software’s limitation, treatment setup can be proceeded only by one method at a time, either by stereotactic localizer box or ExacTrac image guided system, therefore, the phantom and each patient had two treatment plans of the same treatment center. We started to setup by the traditional SRS procedure first, i.e., matching the treatment center in the stereotactic localizer box from the first plan, and then we took two fixed angled oblique radiographs to check the difference between this treatment center and that from the digital reconstructed radiographs of the second treatment plan.\\nResults: In phantom's test, the setup error of stereotactic frame box with maskring is 1.1 mm in AP direction, and 1mm in lateral direction, in contrast to 0.2 mm in AP, and 0.4 mm in lateral direction by ExacTrac x-ray verification system. Patients with immobilization using headring had less displacement error, all were smaller than 1 mm or within 1 degree of rotation except in vertical direction. In contrast, immobilization using maskring had larger displacement, but all of them were smaller than 3 mm or within 2 degrees. The setup accuracy of localizer box could be affected by the reproducibility of maskring, and this factor can be corrected in ExacTrac image guided system. Conclusion : For SRS, the setup error is usually required to be within 1 mm for rapid dose fall-off outside of the target, and headring can meet this requirement; maskring, usually used in the SRT, had larger setup error, and this should be taken into account in defining treatment target. The adoption of image guided system for double-check of the treatment center could be beneficial in reducing the setup error, especially in the SRT treatment.\"},\n",

The preoperative treatment consisted of chemotherapy (5-Fluorouracil plus Leucovorin) and external-beam radiotherapy (ranged from 4140 cGy to 5940 cGy). After the CRT course, surgical intervention was performed in all of the patients. Surgical procedures included abdominoperineal resection, low anterior resection, and Hartmann's procedure.

We developed an electronic registry system (ERS) that can help to establish a database, which consisted of 986 cases of primary brain tumors in children younger than 18 years of age in Taipei Veterans General Hospital from January 1975 to May 2004. In this study, we focused on the long-term outcomes of 371 available patients treated by radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: In our original cancer registry data, there were 529 pediatric brain tumor patients who underwent radiotherapy between January 1975 and May 2004. However, after reviewing the cases, only 371 cases (70.1%) were fully recorded without missing data. Profiles of radiotherapy for these patients were input into our newly established ERS. The demographic data were analyzed, including classification of tumors, gender distribution, mortality case numbers after radiotherapy, age at treatment, dose profile of radiotherapy, and proportion of patients receiving radiotherapy. For some diseases of interest, overall survival, progression-free survival and postradiotherapy failure-free survival were also analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.\\nResults: Of the 371 patients receiving radiotherapy, treatment for medulloblastomas is the most common (n=93), followed by germinomas (n=59), astrocytomas (n=36), anaplastic astrocytomas (n=36) and brain stem tumors (n=29). The proportions of patients receiving radiotherapy for medulloblastomas, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, astrocytomas (grade Ⅱ), anaplastic astrocytomas, glioblastomas and germinomas were 70.9%, 90.4%, 48.65%, 80.0%, 41.0% and 78.6%, respectively. The pooled mortality rate of all diseases after radiotherapy was 43.93%. The five-year overall survival rates of medulloblastomas, astrocytomas (grade Ⅱ), anaplastic astrocytomas and germinomas were 81.73%, 71.49%, 25.34% and 88.94%, respectively. The 5-year progression-free survival of medulloblastomas was 66.46%. Additionally, seven patients (1.89%) suffered from radiation-induced secondary tumors after completion of radiotherapy for a period of time (range, 2.8 to 24 years; median, 19.7 years).\\nConclusion: An electronic registry system can help to facilitate the statistical analysis for rare pediatric brain tumor data. Our demographic and survival analyses were mostly comparable with those of previous studies. The database of pediatric brain tumors is worthy continuing to provide materials for further studies.'},\n",

There were 17 females and 41 males, with a median age of 51.5 (range 27-88). The disease was Stage Ⅰ in 3 (5%), Stage Ⅱ in 12 (21%), Stage Ⅲ in 29 (50%), and Stage Ⅳ in 14 (24%). IMRT was delivered using a dynamic multileaf collimator. Thirty-one patients received concomitant cisplatin and 5FU, and seventeen patients received concomitant cisplatin. Among them, thirty-one patients received adjuvant cisplatin and 5-FU chemotherapy. The prescribed dose was 66-72 Gy to the gross tumor volume and positive neck nodes, 46.8-50 Gy to the clinically negative neck. Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) radiation morbidity scoring criteria. The local control, local-regional control, distant metastasis-free, and the overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\\nResults : With a median follow-up of 19.3 months (range 7 to 41 months), there were 11 local recurrences at the primary site. Seven patients failed in the neck. Seven patients developed distant metastases; 6 of these patients died. The 2-year local control, local-regional control, and distant metastases-free rates were 78%, 74%, and 85% respectively. The 2-year overall survival was 86%. With 11 and 13 patents experiencing local and locoregional failure, only stage of disease was a significant predictor by multivariate analysis. IMRT with concomitant cisplatin and 5FU had treatment outcomes similar to IMRT with concomitant cisplatin alone, but this regimen was associated with more severe acute toxicity. At 19.3 months (median) after IMRT, 7% of the patients had Grade 3 xerostomia, 41% had Grade 2, 26% had Grade 1 and 2% had no xerostomia.\\nConclusion: Our preliminary results using IMRT for treatment of NPC were reported. Further study to compare concomitant cisplatin and 5FU with cisplatin alone is warranted. A larger case number and longer follow-up time were needed to confirm our preliminary results.'},\n",

In this study, we intend to quantify the importance of the volume shrinkage of parotid gland and its influence on the dose distribution of parotid glands among patients with or without significant body weight loss.\\nMaterial and Methods: From Feb. 2003 to Oct. 2005, 30 patients with NPC were enrolled into this study. 13 patients suffered from significant body weight loss (＞6% of their origin body weight at the end of the 4th week of the entire RT course). A 2nd plan CT scan images were acquired after every patient had received 41.4 to 46.8 Gy of prescribed dose. A second IMRT plan was generated for the cone-down treatment. However, we also created a 2nd plan (Hybrid 2nd plan) for the 1st CT images to assume if no 2nd plan CT images were available.\\nResults: The reductions of body contours are highly correlated with the body weight loss of the patients. The parotid glands decrease in size no matter the patients had significant body weight loss or not. When comparing the dosimetric effects of Hybrid and New 2nd plan, there were no significant dosimetric differences of target coverage. However, increases in the doses of normal tissue such as brainstem, spinal cord, left and right parotid glands were noted. In the subgroup analysis, there were significant increase of spinal cord, brainstem, R't parotid gland doses and hot spots in PTV(subscript CTV1) for patients with significant body weight loss. For patients without significant body weight loss, there were increases of spinal cord and brainstem doses but the target dose coverage remained satisfactory.\\nConclusions: We conclude that the volume of parotid glands decreased significantly during the course of IMRT even in patients without significant body weight loss. A 2nd plan CT and a new 2nd IMRT plan based on the new CT scan are needed for the IMRT treatment of NPC.\"},\n",

This was done on head and neck (H&N) cancer patients who were not guided by imaging based on the effective treatment results of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).\\nMaterial and Methods : 20 patients underwent image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) resulted in a total of 386 paired images which were analyzed by software to acquire the correction shifts in three axis, followed by recalculation of a treatment plan system. The effect of PTV and normal tissue irradiation volume were evaluated by plan summation.\\nResults: The average correction shift of anterior-posterior (AP), medial-lateral (RL) and cranio-caudal (CC) directions were -0.4±0.9 mm, -0.4±1.2 mm and -0.1±0.7 mm, respectively. The systematic and random errors in AP direction were 0.9 mm and 0.9 mm, in RL direction were 0.7 mm and 0.9 mm, in SI direction were 1.2 mm and 1.1 mm. The average vector shift was 2.1±0.3 mm with 88% probability of being less than 3 mm.\\nIn brain and H&N tumor groups, the PTV missing probability of V90 (the volume covered by 90% isodose curve), V95 (the volume covered by 95% isodose curve) and V107 (the volume covered by 107% isodose curve) were 0.15% and 0.17%, 0.37% and 0.39%, 0.03% and 0.31%, respectively.

Oncocytic carcinomas are even more uncommon, comprising only approximately 5% of all oncocytomas. In a critical review of the international medical literature, only a few cases of oncocytic carcinoma of submandibular gland were found. Even more unusual was the fact in this case, it arose from a previously benign oncocytoma. We describe this case of submandibular oncocytoma transforming into a malignancy associated with regional lymph node metastases.\\nPatient and Methods: A rare case of 51 year-old man with malignant oncocytoma is presented. The tumor was found in the left submandibular gland with regional lymph node enlargement.\\nResults and Conclusion: Oncocytic carcinoma appears to arise from benign oncocytomas, or may also arise de novo. In oncocytic carcinoma of the head and neck, the presence of distant, rather than local lymph node, metastasis is the most important prognostic indicator. Therapy consists of surgical resection and radiotherapy but the efficacy of radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are still unclear.'},\n",

With a median follow-up time of 19 months, local failure developed in 6 of 88 (7%) and distant metastases occurred in 16 of 88 (18%). The 2-year overall survival (OS) are comparable between these two groups (OS: SCRT-96.0% vs. CCRT-86.9%, p=0.48). In terms of disease-free survival (DFS), patients in the SCRT group have borderline significant better 2-year DFS as compared with CCRT group (DFS: SCRT-82.4% vs. CCRT-62.4%, p=0.06).\\nConclusion: Pre-operative SCRT and CCRT are equally effective in terms of the resectability and sphincter preservation in stage II-III rectal cancer. A higher tumor response (downstaging and complete tumor response) was noted in the CCRT group. The long term results of overall tumor control and survivals between these two groups still need longer follow-up time to disclose.'},\n",

In the past 20 years, there have been only two primary breast angiosarcomas treated in our hospital.\\nMaterials and Methods: Here we report on two cases of primary breast angiosarcoma with different presentations and treatment strategies. One underwent total mastectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. The other one underwent modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection.\\nResult: The prognosis for primary breast sarcoma is highly dependent on the tumor size; higher grade and positive margins increase the risk of local recurrence and thus a decreased survival rate. One patient completed the adjuvant radiotherapy in January 2008 because of the larger tumor bed. The other one underwent surgery only due to the fact that the small lesion was still disease-free after almost 3 years.\\nConclusion: The treatment of choice for angiosarcoma is surgery with adequate margins. Axillary dissection is not indicated because nodal metastasis is rare. The definitive role of adjuvant therapy remains undetermined. Due to the high locoregional recurrent rate of this disease, local therapy should be optimized with multimodality treatment. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may play an important role in survival.'},\n",

An experiment was undertaken with a home-made aswirl board that enables the patient to lie in supine or prone position for treatment.\\nMaterial and Methods: A 6 MeV nominal electron beam was delivered using Elekta Precise Sli throughout this experiment. The patient is treated at a isocenter to skin distance of 350 cm. The largest field size available at SSD 100 cm is 40x40cm^2 and a high dose rate of 3000 MU min^(-1) was used. A 0.6 cm thick acrylic beam spoiler was placed 90cm away from the surface of the patient to scatter the electron beam for a more homogeneous surface dose. Patients are treated with two groups in prone and supine position by leaning on inner rotational board in prone and supine position, each group can further be separated into two subgroup with tilting and rotation positions for treatment. By incorporating all these seeting on the aswirl board with the optimal gantry angle, the patient will final accumulate compensated dosages on whole body surface.\\nResults: One of the gantry beam was directed 15.5° upward and the other 15.5° downward from the horizontal axis to provide a field size as large as 200 cm in height and 140cm in width. An incline angle of 31.50° anteriorly (forward) or posteriorly (backward) of the middle frame and an angle rotated 60° clockwise or counterclockwise of the inner frame is found to be most appropriate. The output dose rate for the AB-TSET was 0.085 cGy/mu at SSD 350 cm. The beam characteristics of the AB-TSET depth dose curves were R50=1.25cm, d(subscript max)=0.6 cm E0=2.913 MeV, R(subscript p)=1.75 cm.\\nConclusion: The AB-TSET technique presented in this study is able to deliver a uniform dose to the patient’s skin surface as well as to the vertex and the soles all in one time, eliminating the troubles of having to further boost fields for these two regions when using the Stanford Six Field Technique.'},\n",

Until April 2005, thirty-one patients received adjuvant CCRT with median dose of 45 Gy (ranged from 14.4 to 50.4 Gy). The other thirty-five patients in this period had no other treatment after radical surgery.\\nResults Multivariate analysis of Cox regression showed the factors of stages, treatment methods, and surgical dissection (D1 or D2) were significant prognostic factors for survival rate. By using Kaplan-Meier methods, the 3-year survival and local control rates in adjuvant CCRT group were 61.3% and 76.4%, and the 3-year survival and local control rates in operation alone group were 40% and 47.9% (significantly lower, log-rank p＜0.05). The most common severe acute toxicity in the adjuvant CCRT group was gastro-intestinal (GI) grade Ⅲ complication according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group for acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Six out of 31 patients with CCRT (19.4%) had the grade Ⅲ G1 acute side effect.\\nConclusion: Adjuvant CCRT after radical gastrectomy might significantly improve survival and local control in patients with gastric adenocarcinonia of stage Ⅱ, Ⅲ, and Ⅳ (MO) in our experience.'},\n",

When cell irraiation was performed by using a high energy radiotherapy Linac, the dose uncertainties caused by the inhomogeneity structures of the cell containers make it difficult to estimate the cell dose. In this study, cell doses were measured and analysised for different setup conditions.\\nMaterials and Methods: 6 MV, 10 MV photon beams and 10 MeV, 12 MeV, 15 MeV electron beams generated by Electa SL-18 Linac were used in this study. Field sizes of 20×20 cm^2 for photon beams and 25×25 cm^2 for electron beams were designed to have a fully side scatter condition. Dosimetry analyses for AP and PA directions were performed for 86 mm×l9.5 mm Polystyrene petri dish, 25 cm^2×24.3 mm and 75 cm^2×36.5 mm Tissue Culture Flask. Extra thin TLDs (0.1 mm) were used for dose measurements. The cell irradiation condition is similar to the inhomogeneity distribution in a human body. GET (Coefficient of Equivalent Thickness) is used to evaluation the dose distribution which beyond the inhomogeneity structures. The dose variations for calculation and measurement were analyzed in different setup conditions.\\nResults and Discussion: In AP setup, the calculation dose was consistent for electron beams, within 3%, but was under estimated for both of photon beams, maximum variation of 7% in 6 MV and 5% in 10 MV. In PA setup, the calculation doses were under estimated for electron and photon beams, and are more significant for higher photon energy and larger air cavity. The depth dose distribution in buildup region is much sharper for photon beam than electron beam. This behavior makes a smaller dose variation in electron beams than in photon beams when evaluated position is located at the buildup area.'},\n",

To our knowledge, there is no case of LEC in sublingual gland reported in the medical literature.\\nMaterials and Methods: We report the first case of LEC of the sublingual tumor of a 37-year-old Taiwanese man. The initial presentation was a mass over the submental area. PET/CT scan showed there was only a locoregional disease, which was limited in the left mouth floor and submental lymph node. Naopharynx was not involved at the same time. Serological studies showed elevated titer of Epstein-Barr virus: capsid antigen IgG and IgA antibodies. Immunohistochemical stain of LMP-1 also showed the positive result.

All postoperative radiotherapy was planned using an intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment planning system and was administered 4-6 weeks after operation. Seven out of 30 patients received post-radiotherapy adjuvant chemotherapy. Radiation from 6-7 beam angles, which was designed according to specific shape of clinical target volume (CTV), was delivered by a linear accelerator with energy of 6 MV photons. The CTV included the whole esophageal region plus the supraclavicular region for tumors at the upper and middle thoracic portion of the esophagus or celiac region for tumor situated at the lower thoracic portion. A total dose of 50 Gy to 60 Gy was aimed at the PTV over 5 to 6 weeks. Treatment response was evaluated and toxicities were assessed. The organ at risk dose profile was calculated under isocenter dose of 50 Gy.\\nResults: Radiotherapy related acute toxicities were mild. Organs at risk such as lungs, heart, and spinal cord were spared from the prescribed doses. The mean doses for right and left lungs were 13.1 Gy and 13.3 Gy, respectively. The lung volume received doses of 2000 cGy or more (V20) for right and left lung was 19.7% and 19.8%, respectively. The mean dose to heart was 22.4 Gy and only 9.8% of heart tissue received a dosage over 40 Gy (V40). For spinal cord, the maximum dose was 36.5 Gy which is relatively low. An average conformity index (CI) of 0.8 implies high treatment conformity to the target. An average homogeneity index (HI) of 0.94 indicated good dose homogeneity within the target. After a mean follow-up of 14 months, 5 local recurrences were found over anastomotic site in 1 patient, supraclavicular region in 1 patient and subcarina region in 3 patients, the local recurrence rate in 2-year period is 22.4%. The 2-year overall survival rate was 45.1%. Distant metastasis is the most important reason for those who died within 2 year period of follow-up.\\nConclusion: Postoperative IMRT using 6 to 7 beams has good coverage of the target and high dose homogeneity while decreasing doses to normal tissue. Local control was good with an acceptable 2-year survival rate. However, early distant metastasis remains to be a problem. New approaches are needed to improve the clinical outcome.'},\n",

Using the Co-60 source of 29190 curies, which located in the Nuclear Science and Technology Development Center of National Tsing Hua University, performed calibration of the gamma dose sensitivity. The radiation sensitivity and the range of the linear response were obtained by irradiating the dosimeter with various dose rates and different total dose.

The accumulated self-exciting dose for Na-24 is only 1.12 mGy during its average life-time for irradiation of total thermal neutron fluence of 3.6E12 nth/cm^2.\\nConclusions: Because of the self-exciting dose reduced from neutron activation can be neglected for gamma dose measurement in neutron and gamma mixed field, and the threshold of linear response is 2 Gy, the FWT-70-40 (M) dosimeter not only can be used for high dose rate Co-60 irradiation field and the high energy electron beam for medical purpose, but also can be used for gamma dose measurement in an epithermal neutron beam for boron neutron capture therapy.'},\n",

One hundred and five patients were male (95.5%) and 5 patients were female (4.5%). The median age of diagnosis was 52 year-old (range, 30-77 years). Eighty-seven patients (79.1%) were diagnosed as tonsillar carcinoma, and 23 patients (20.9%) were diagnosed as carcinoma of other oropharyngeal subsites. Histopathologically, well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated and poorly- differentiated carcinoma were 10%, 62.8%, and 27.2%, respectively. Staging classification were 8.2%, 7.3%, 69.1% and 15.5% for stage Ⅱ, Ⅲ, IVa, and IVb, respectively. Forty-nine patients were treated with resection of primary tumor with or without neck dissection. Thirty-two of all 110 patients (29.0%) received surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, 17 patients (15.5%) received surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Seventeen patients (15.5%) were treated with radiotherapy alone, and 44 patients (40.0%) were treated with definitive radiotherapy plus chemotherapy.\\nResults: The follow-up period ranged from 2.4 to 130.2 months (median, 17 months). During the follow-up period, 39 patients (35.5%) were alive and 71 patients (64.5%) died. Five-year overall survival rate, disease-free survival rate, and loco-regional control rate of oropharyngeal cancer were 28.4%, 28.8%, and 58.4%, respectively. Five-year overall survival rate for the group of RT alone, definitive RT+C/T, OP+ adjuvant RT and OP+ adjuvant CCRT were 24.8%, 14.1%, 36.9%, and 45.8%, respectively. Gender, tumor site, histopathology and surgery significantly predicted survival in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, surgery was the only significant predictor for overall and disease-free survival, while tumor site and surgery were the significant predictors for loco-regional control.\\nConclusion: Surgery was significantly predicted for loco-regional control and overall survival in this retrospective study. However, improving radiotherapy technique and addition of chemotherapy have changed the practice of oropharyngeal cancer in recent years with organ preservation without compromising the treatment results.'},\n",

Given that several lines of evidence suggesting a potential synergistic or additive effect of antiangiogenic therapy and radiation, we examined whether the addition of LDM chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide could enhance the response of subcutaneously inoculated melanoma, B16F10, to radiation in a syngenic murine model.\\nMaterials and Methods: One day after subcutaneous B16F10 inoculation on the flanks, c57/BL6 mice were given cyclophosphamide at 0, 6, or 20 mg/kg/day through drinking water on a daily basis throughout the whole course of experiment. On 16th day after tumor inoculation, tumors bearing mice, which were given 0 or 6 mg/kg/day were either irradiated with 8 Gy or left untreated.

Efficacy of LDM cyclophosphamide was demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner. A single fraction of 8 Gy radiation significantly delayed the growth of melanoma and the effect was further enhanced by concomitant administration of LDM cyclophosphamide with an enhancement factor of 2.4.\\nConclusion: The clinical benefit of LDM cyclophosphamide may be further tested in clinical trials.

Two different constrain sets of CD IMRT plan had been done with the same C-IMRT plan for each patient. Isodose distributions, dose-volume histograms (DVHs), and the various dosimetric parameters were generated and calculated for each plans. Comparison was made to evaluate the differences of DVHs and composite isodose distributions of 2 CD constrain sets both superimposed on the initial C-IMRT planning. We also compared the monitor unit (MU) in two CD constrain sets plans.\\nResult: Our finding showed that the initial IMRT plan has a great impact on CD IMRT plan. Dependent constrain sets in CD IMRT plan could be negatively influenced by the initial IMRT plan with unacceptable surplus of MUs due to the non-uniform intensity map summarization. The independent constrain sets may not generate an acceptable composite dose distribution since summation of the two acceptable individual intensity maps may not create an optimum composite intensity to meet the final dose criteria. However, taken all consideration together, the independent constrain sets could be adequate for CD IMRT plan.\\nConclusion and Discussion: According to the aforementioned planning comparisons, it is perfered to implement the CD IMRT plan without summating the initial IMRT plan. CD IMRT paln with independent constrain sets was prefered over dependent constrain sets because of consistent minimum tumor coverage in the cone down phase, similar tumor coverage, equal critial organ sparing and bioradiological evaluation. The dose constrains defined in the initial IMRT plan has a great effect on the critical organ dose. Analysis of the composite IMRT plan is indispensable.'},\n",

The response of symptomatic relief was assessed with endoscope, radiography and the subjective sensation of these patients.\\nResults: Relief of endobronchial tumor-related symptoms and external compression from peribronchial tumor was noted in 35 of 50 patients (70%) treated with EBBT. No grade III-IV complication was observed.\\nConclusion: HDR-EBBT is an effective and safe palliative tool in locally advanced lung cancer, with a relatively long duration of symptom palliation and a considerable improvement in the quality of life. There is also significant reduction of endobronchial obstruction.'},\n",

Technical difficulty, expected dismal prognosis, and lack of supporting evidences are possible reasons contributing to the lack of attention paid to this matter. This report may be a first on an aggressive brain radiation for symptomatic disseminated brain metastases, more than 40 tumor foci, using tomotherapy. The patient in question is a 44 year-old lady with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. Symptomatic disseminated brain metastases concurrent with progression of intrapulmonary disease developed after months of remission achieved by primary chemotherapy. Because of her relative young age and good performance status, an aggressive brain radiation was performed in a hope to deliver a better intracranial control during the period of ensuing salvage chemotherapy. A whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of 30 Gy in 15 fractions was delivered first and achieved a good palliative effect of ameliorating her brain edema and reducing the tumor sizes. A sequential tumor boost to all observable tumor foci was delivered three weeks after WBRT to a total dose of 56 Gy for two large masses or 50 Gy for other small masses, respectively, without incurring significant toxicity. The treatment to the patient is quite successful, taking into consideration of its good palliative effects as well as low toxicity.

Twenty-two of them were eligible for this study, because 13 patients were proven to have EBV infection in their nasopharynx or neck lymph nodes. Fourteen (64%) received surgery and postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (7 patients) or radiotherapy alone (7 patients). Others who did not receive surgery were treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (3 patients), radiotherapy (3 patients), or induction chemotherapy with radiotherapy (2 patients). Total prescription dose ranged from 6000 cGy to 7280 cGy with a median of 6750 cGy to Waldeyer's ring and involved neck.\\nResults: The median follow-up duration was 8 years (ranged from 5 to 14 years). Nine (41%) patients were alive, and 13 (59%) patients died. Nine (41%) patients had neck recurrence, including four patients with uncontrolled neck mass enlargement. Only 2 patients developed distant metastases. The 3-year, 5-year, and 8-year overall survival were 50%, 50%, and 42%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival for N1, N2, and N3 patients were 100%, 44%, and 33% (P value=0.019), respectively. In multivariant analysis, only both upper and lower neck involvement was a significant predictor for overall survival. The 3-year and 5-year regional control rates were 60% and 53%, respectively. For N1, N2, and N3 diseases, the 5-year regional control rates were 100%, 67%, and 17% (P value=0.034), respectively. In multivariant analysis, only both upper and lower neck involvement reached statistical significance for regional control. If patients initially were treated with neck node dissection, 5-year overall survival and regional control rate were 64% and 67%, respectively. If surgery was not performed initially, 5-year overall survival and regional control rate were 25% and 31%, respectively. Although all statistics did not reach significance, we still found a trend that favor surgery initially group. Better results were also noted in N3 patients.\\nConclusion: The treatment for neck nodal control of unknown primary head and neck cancer without EBV infection is challenging. In our present study, this group of patients had poor neck control if neck dissection was not performed initially or both upper and lower neck involvement. Neck dissection is suggested for patients with unknown primary head and neck cancer, especially those without EBV infection.\"},\n",

We reviewed hospital charts, radiotherapy records and diagnostic imaging studies thoroughly. Tumor staging was defined according to the Masaoka staging system. Baseline characteristics of patients were median age 47 (range 22-83), male/female=26/12, stage Ⅰ/Ⅱ/Ⅲ/Ⅳ=4/15/15/4. The radiotherapy was delivered by a wedge-pair or 3-D conformal-beam technique with a median dose of 50 Gy (range 40-68 Gy) by conventional fractionation. The end points were overall survival (OS), locoregional disease-free survival (LDFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) by the Kaplan-Meier method.\\nResults: After a median follow-up of 11 years, 13 of 38 patients had tumor relapse (2 locoregional recurrence, 7 distant metastasis, and 4 locoregional plus distant failure). The 5-year and 10-year of OS, LDFS, and MFS for all patients were 75.5% and 51.2%, 82.1% and 82.1%, and 83.5% and 56.7%, respectively. On univariate analysis, stages and the extent of surgical resection were the most important prognostic factors.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To report the experience of postoperative radiation therapy (RT) for keloid at a teaching hospital.\\nMaterial and Methods: We recruited patients with keloid or hypertrophic scar lesions who received excision and postoperative RT from 1999 to 2003 at a teaching hospital. We use 6 MeV electron beam covered with 0.5-1 cm Superflap as bolus to enhance skin dose, and the electron beam margin was designed as 0.5 to 1 cm from re-operative suture line area. All of them were treated with 15 Gy of RT in five fractions in consecutive days, except one who had problems in scheduling the last treatment and received 12 Gy in four fractions. We summarized information on their outcomes and evaluated the possible prognostic factors.\\nResults: A total of nine patients were observed during the study period, including one man and eight women. Five of them were satisfied with their outcomes, two had fair outcome, and two felt disappointed. Of the two disappointed patients, one had a gross keloid, and the other had an elapsed time of 17 days between excision and radiation. One of the patients with satisfactory outcome, however, had an elapsed time of 6 days. All the other six patients who had satisfactory or fair outcomes started RT within 2 days after surgery. Eight patients received 15 Gy in five fractions, and one received 12 Gy in four fractions. No second malignancy was observed during the study period. Among all variables evaluated, ugly as the initial symptom was the only significant factor associated with satisfaction, but none was associated with the outcome.\\nConclusion: The dose-fractions between 12 and 15 Gy in four or five fractions are feasible in postoperative RT for keloid or hypertrophic scar. Starting the RT within 2 to 3 days should be suggested after excision. Unsatisfactory response is still possible under this timing and dose-fractions, especially for gross lesions.'},\n",

Of the 374 patients, 285 (76%) had pathologic Ti disease and 89 (24%) T2 disease. Eighty-seven (23%) patients were found to have pathologic involvement of axillary lymph nodes. Two hundred and eighty-one patients (75%) have received adjuvant chemotherapy. The median dose of RT was 46 Gy in 23 fractions to the breast with/without supraclavicular area and internal mammary chain followed by tumor bed boost of 16 Gy. The medical records including pathologic reports were reviewed for analysis of tumor recurrence.\\nResults: There were 16 local and/or regional recurrences (11 LRR only; 5 LRR with distant metastasis) after a median follow-up of 4.2 years. The 5-year disease-free, LRR-free and overall survivals were 87.9%, 95% and 94.1% respectively. The risk factors of LRR include age equal to or less than 40 years old, multifocal or multicentric disease, and positive or close surgical margin. All 10 patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence only were still alive without disease after salvage simple mastectomy (range, 9~134 months; median 60 months).\\nConclusion: Breast-conserving surgery followed by RT provided excellent local-regional control for early breast cancer. Patients with risk factors of young age, close/positive margin, and multifocal/multicentric disease need to be followed closely.'},\n",

       "  'e': \"Purpose: We present a quality assurance (QA) schedule for the Hi-Art Helical Tomo-Therapy unit and share our QA practical experience with this state-of-the-art machine. According to the Ionizing Radiation Protection Act (Article. 17, item 3), the regulation of medical exposure QA in Taiwan has to include daily, monthly, and annual items in the schedule for every treatment machine in a radiation oncology department. The Hi-Art Helical Tomo-Therapy unit was developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2003. We installed a new system at Yuan's General Hospital to take the lead in South- Taiwan in April 2006. In this study, we present the QA schedule that is performed in our department, which follows the principles of AAPM TG-40 but contains some novel components, reflecting the differences between the Hi-Art device and conventional linear accelerators.\\nMaterials and Methods: We compared the efficiency of the daily, monthly, and annual QA programs in our department with Hi-Art Helical Tomo-Therapy unit and an Elekta-Precise linear accelerator with a standard QA schedule. We followed the principles of AAPM TG-40. For tomotherapy, the QA program included a series of measurements that were recorded in a specially fabricated, cylindrically symmetric Virtual Water phantom. This was designed specifically for commissioning the Helical Tomo-Therapy unit and QA. The phantom is 30cm in diameter, 18cm long, and is divided into two halves, such that film may be placed between them.\\nTo perform the measurements of the dosimetry parameters and correction factors, three EXRADIN-A1SL ion chambers and a Standard Imaging-TomoEletrometer were used for the Helical Tomo-Therapy unit, and a 0.6CC PTW TM30013 Farmer chamber with PTW T0008 Eletrometer was used for the Elekta-Precise linear accelerator. For the beam quality measurements, the dedicated TomoTherapy electrometer measurement system (TEMS) along with a two-dimensional radiation beam analyzer (TomoScanner) and a PTW-Freiburg MP3-S therapy beam analyzer water phantom system were performed the scanning for the beam symmetrical profiles assessment for the corresponding machine respectively.\\nResults: The lengths of time required for daily QA program was almost the same for the two machines. However, the monthly and annual programs were more efficient for the Hi-Art Helical TomoTherapy, saving 2 hours and 10 hours compared to the Elekta-Precise linear accelerator, respectively. The statistical data collected over the past 10 months show that the time spent for the TomoTherapy was less, and the tolerance value was lower than that of the Elekta-Precise linear accelerator; the output error of daily QA was within ±1% for 75% of the data, within ±2% for 18.75% of the data, and within +3% for the remaining 6.25% of the data, and the dose output error value for the monthly QA was less than ±1%.\\nConclusions： The following conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, the time needed for the QA schedule for the Hi-Art Helical TomoTherapy is less than that required for routine work with a linear accelerator. Due to the TomoTherapy machine intrinsic characteristics, some mechanical items, such as the gantry, the couch angle, the collimator etc., do not need to be checked. Additionally, no electron beam verification is needed but the same beam effect can be formed from the different beamlets of the machine. Nonetheless, Helical TomoTherapy has a relatively short clinical track record and, as further operational experience is gained, it may be found that some QA items will need to be modified and some additional tests may need to be developed for completeness of the QA schedule.\"},\n",

The combination of double gene EGT and DC treatment induced heavy T cell infiltration inside tumor. Mice successfully treated by the combination of immunotherapy & radiotherapy can induce a systemic immunity to prevent the contralateral tumor challenge. Interestingly, the immunological favorable micro-environment established in the tumor site by this protocol created a highly effective condition for subsequent radiotherapy.\\nConclusions: Our findings may have clinical implications in achieving better local control and prevention of systemic relapse through the combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: Dosimetry accuracy in surface and build-up region is inadequate for commercialized treatment planning systems. This uncertainty is more significant for IMRT with inverse treatment planning procedure and may cause a severe skin reaction for head and neck cancer. In this study, various target contouring methods for IMRT planning are used to analyze the dosimetry effects in buildup region.\\nMaterials and Methods: 6-MV photon beams generated by Varian 21EX and Varian Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS) are used in this study. A 16cm diameter ball phantom was used for superficial dose measurements. Three different planning target volume (PTV) shrinkage methods (0, 3, 5 mm) were designed for IMRT planning. Plan optimizations are performed with same dose constraint condition. Dose calculations are performed with 2.5 mm grid size and with inhomogeneity correction methods (Equivalent TAR, Batho Power Law and Modified Batho). Extra thin TLDs (0.1 mm) are used for surface and superficial dose measurements. TPS calculated doses in different conditions are compared with the measurement data. A guidance may be established in this issue to assess the method of IMRT target contouring and the estimation of superficial dose from TPS.\\nResults: A significant high intensity distribution at superficial area was shown for PTV margin extend to body surface and shrink 0mm. The highest variations between measurements and calculations (+40% to -24%) also existed in this condition and at body surface. Most of the TPS calculation data are under estimated except for points at 80° and 280° on body surface are over estimated. The under estimation is more significant for ETAR. The variation is reduced for deeper position. At 6mm depth, the variation is within 5% for BPL and MB methods.\\nConclusions: The variations are more significant at shallow position. When tumor invasion is close to body surface, a bolus of proper thickness is the method to increase the superficial dose and to have a correct calculation dose. On the other, if superficial area is not a risk area, proper PTV margin shrinkage will be necessary to avoid the skin reaction.'},\n",

The ratio of hepatoma derived growth factor (HDGF)/β-tubulin of the untreated cells was calculated from the protein band in Western blot gel after densitometer quantization.

The GSH content were 95, 247, 70, and 177 umol/mg and the HDGF/ beta-tubulin ratio were 0.827, 0.152, 0.987, and 0.520 in those 4 cell lines. The level of HDGF/β-tubulin was inversely correlated with GSH (R^2=0.994, p=0.0032). However, Bcl-2 amounts did not correlate with GSH or HDGF/β-tubulin. Linear correlation was also observed between apoptosis and GSH except Mahlavu cell with R2 value of 0.98 (p=0.05).

The HDGF/beta-tubulin level correlated well with GSH activity. HDGF levels in the 4 hepatoma cells correlated with the degree of the radiation-induced apoptosis treated with 20 Gy. However, this differential apoptotic effect among the four different Hepatoma cell lines can not be solely attributed to the amount of GSH or HDGF contents. Highest Bcl-2 concentration was observed in the Mahlavu cell which might rescue the apoptotic effect due to irradiation. Further investigation for the Bcl-2 effect on GSH is necessary to elucidate this relationship to explore the possibility of using the combined pattern of these biomarkers as the prognostic factors.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: Radiochromic film has gained increasing popularity in medical applications in recent years. It has several advantageous features, including high spatial resolution, relatively low spectral sensitivity, near tissue equivalence, and it requires no special development procedure. This study aimed to evaluate the response of new type Gafchromic EBT film for high energy photon beams in clinical use. \\nMaterial and Methods: The ISP Gafchromic EBT film (prototype A) and ELEKTA Precise LINAC were used in this study. Gafchromic EBT films were exposed to radiation of difference energies, dose rates, fractionation and to the ambient light respectively. After completely being exposed, we scanned the film with Radlink Laserport 16 scanner and Epson Perfection 4990 photo scanner in red, blue, green channel and gray scale respectively. The post-exposure density growth with varied time was also evaluated. The calibration curves for high energy photon beams were established.\\nResults: The results showed that the effect of dose fractionation was insignificant, and there is no significant energy dependence on 4MV, 6MV and 10MV photon beams. The response using red light source of Epson scanner against corresponding delivered dose is higher than that of the green, blue channel, gray scale and Radlink LaserPor scanner at doses below 4 Gy. The gray scale model showed the lowest response in all scanners. It is interesting that the green light source would have the highest response when the dose was greater than 4 Gy. The post-exposure density growth test showed a slight increase between 1st to 5th day, at sixth day, an obvious decrease occur, then became stable between 7th to 14th day. However, the net OD was nonlinear with time and dose, continuous exposure to the room light for 24 hours resulted in a density change of about 0.117, which is equivalent to a radiation exposure of about 10 cGy.\\nConclusion: Gafchromic EBT film is a new type of film for radiotherapy dosimetry. Its response to different dose rates and dose fractionations were insignificant, but theresults of the effect for room light exposure were not as good ad expected. However, it is still a reliable dosimeter for clinical dosimetry. Our suggestion is to read the film at least 24 hours after irradiation, and scan the films with color scanner in red channel to obtain better response. Furthermore, the film should be kept properly when not in use to avoid other confoundedly influences.'},\n",

The organs doses from scatter radiation are measured, and then the risk is evaluated. For stochastic effect, we estimate the risk for these patients to increase the chance of secondary malignancy and other possible late biological effects.\\nMaterials and Methods: First of all, we calibrated the energy and output factor for 6 MV x-ray from a linear accelerator (Elekta Precise-Sli). One monitor unit (MU) output was calibrated as 1 cGy. The accuracy and sensitivity of TLD-100H dosimeters were also measured. TLD-100H dosimeters within 3% accuracy were applied in the study. TLD-100H dosimeters were placed in different anatomical positions of the Rando phantom, then the Rando phantom was irradiated the head and neck area as NPC treatment by IMRT technique. The data of different organs doses were obtained separately for each of IMRT irradiation. The tissue fatal cancer probability and total risk were estimated following the ICRP Publication No.60.\\nResults: Total radiation dose in the IMRT treatment course was 72 Gy in 40 fractions. Len received 4.03 Gy, which had relatively risks to induce cataract. Heart received 0.86 and kidney received 0.19 Gy, which were far less than their maximal tolerance dose. According to the data calculation from ICRP Publication No.60 the lung and esophagus have about 1~7% fatal cancer probability, which depended on the distance of the position from radiation fields. The fatal cancer probability rate for others organs were 0.04~0.1%.\\nConclusion: The overall risks for inducing fatal cancer is about 0.75%, and the risks for the adjacent tissues to the radiation fields are about 7%.

Clinical charts, pathology reports, radiology images and radiotherapy records were reviewed. Patients' characteristics, details of treatment modalities and clinical outcome were collected. Sixteen patients were re-staged with three staging system including: Kadish, Dulguerov and the 6th AJCC staging system for nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Histo-pathological specimens of 17 patients were reviewed to define the tumor grading using Hyams' four-tier system.\\nResults: There were 9 male and 8 female, age ranged from 14 to 74 years old. According to Kadish's classification, there were 3 stage A, 3 stage B and 10 stage C diseases. The most common symptom was epistaxis. Thirteen patients received treatment at our institute. A median follow-up time of 40.3 months (mean: 48.6 months), 6 patients were alive without disease and 4 were alive with disease. Locoregional failure occurred in 5 patients and distant metastases were noted in 2 patients. Five-year overall survival rate was 52.5% and 5-year disease free survival rate was 42%. Degree of surgery was the only significant prognostic factor in univariate analysis (p=0.021).\\nConclusion: In this study, surgical intervention to total removal of the tumor was the most significant prognostic factor. Adjuvant treatment such as radiotherapy was needed for advanced diseases, in which residual tumor was notified even after radical surgery. Radiotherapy combined with surgical resection was an effective modality for treatment of olfactory neuroblastoma; this combination could provide excellent local control. Most tumors were response to the initial radiotherapy at the range of 55 to 65 Gy. Elective neck irradiation was not needed routinely. Local recurrence might happen even 5 years later, and long-term follow-up should be mandated.\"},\n",

Our study is to evaluate the effect of rectal balloon immobilization in reducing rectal dose during daily treatment of prostate cancer with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).\\nMaterials and Methods: From June 2005 to August 2005, 11 patients with prostate cancer underwent computed tomography (CT) simulations with and without rectal balloon (filled with 60ml air) before and at the end of IMRT course. TMS Helax treatment planning system was used to generate step-and-shoot five coplanar-field IMRT plans. Plans were separately designed with and without a rectal balloon. The prescription dose to clinical target volume (CTV) was 78 Gy in 39 fractions of 2 Gy each. CTV was determined according to the patients' risk category. The dose to 95% of planning target volume (PTV) was 78 Gy. Cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the CTV, PTV, rectum, and bladder. Inter-fractional prostate displacement was measured on two separate CT images with the distance between pubic bone rim/sacrum and anterior/posterior borders of prostate, respectively, at the cranial level of pubic symphysis. To assess the dosimetric difference and inter-fractional variation of balloon setup, the paired Student t-test was used.\\nResults: Patients included in this study had the TNM stage distribution of T1cN0M0 in 4 patients, T2bN0M0 in 4 patients, T3bN0M0 in 2 patients, and T4N0M0 in 1 patient. CTV was prostate alone in 8 patients and prostate plus bilateral seminal vesicles in 3 patients. Minimum dose to CTV with and without a rectal balloon were both 79 Gy in average. Average segment number in plans with and without a rectal balloon were 43 and 42 (P=0.7), respectively. Plans with a rectal balloon showed a significant reduction in rectal volume fraction at 65 Gy (13% vs 17%, P=0.007), and at 70 Gy (9% vs 13%, P=0.005). Plans with a rectal balloon did not show difference in bladder volume fraction at 65 Gy (18% vs 16%, P=0.07). Inter-fractional prostate positions before and at the end of IMRT were similar in the distance from pubic bone to anterior border (0.90cm vs 0.96cm, P=0.6), and posterior border of prostate to sacrum (3.69cm vs 3.73cm, P=0.8). All patients tolerated their whole IMRT course with daily placement of rectal balloon. There was no grade Ⅲ acute toxicity. \\nConclusion: Rectal balloon immobilization during daily fractionated IMRT for prostate cancer is a feasible and reproducible procedure. It would be beneficial to reduce high dose to the rectum. The effect of prostate immobilization is acceptable with minimal inter-fractional setup variation.\"},\n",

The patient who had complete remission was a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia who acquired fungal infection three months after the BMT followed by the relapse and died 1.5 years later. The two patients who went through simulation alone had persistent relapse, and infection episodes hindered them from receiving TBI.\\nConclusion: Our results suggest that infections related to the transportation of patients did not appear to be a key prognostic factor in TBI of BMT patients referred from other hospitals. Although the follow-up time is short and patient number is small, we consider the initial outcome satisfactory. Selection of patients is essential for better result, but partial remission from initial chemotherapy may not necessarily destine to failure.\"},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: External-beam radiotherapy for breast cancer has been shown to reduce the local recurrence. The potentially important gains are often offset by side effect. A major contributing factor to these complications is the inhomogeneity of the dose distribution from tangential irradiation. The objective of this study is to find out the optimal method for breast irradiation which would be applied for clinical patient treatment in the future. \\nMaterials and Methods: Several treatment techniques for tangential breast irradiation were evaluated in this study. The comparisons include two subjects. First, some clinical relevant factors were compared in the result of planning. Second, we will verify the delivery accuracy and delivery time for all techniques using phantom and GAFCHROMIC film. The following four plan techniques were applied for 6 patients: conventional tangents, Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) only tangents, forward IMRT tangents, and conventional open plus IMRT tangents (Hybrid IMRT). \\nResult: The IMRT only tangents, forward IMRT tangents and Hybrid IMRT achieved dose distributions better than conventional tangents. The volume of tissue outside the planning target volume receiving ＞110% of prescribed dose was largest for conventional tangents. Heart volume ＞30 Gy was largest for IMRT only tangents. Average total lung volume ＞20 Gy was largest for IMRT only tangents too. Compare the result in measurement and calculation. Overall, TPS showed good agreement with the measurement in all techniques. However, it was found that there were significant discrepancies in the surface of the phantom. \\nConclusion and Discussion: The hybrid IMRT improve the uniformity of target. The most important is reducing high dose area to the surrounding soft tissue while no increase dose to lung. Besides, planning and treatment time for hybrid techniques is almost the same with conventional technique.'},\n",

Isolated locoregional recurrence (ILRR) \\t \\nwas defined as any recurrence of tumor in the ipsilateral chest wall, mastectomy scar, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, axillary, or internal mammary lymph node (LN), with no \\t \\nother metastasis. A total of 60 patients, with a median age of 47 years (range 29-75 years) were included. The majority of recurrences occurred at the chest wall and around the mastectomy scar (62%). Supra- or infraclavicular LN recurrence represent-\\t \\ned 22% of all ILRR, and axillary failure represented 16%. Fifty-four patients received irradiation after local tumor excision. Six patients had received radiotherapy as part of their primary treatment. In these cases, the involved-field radiotherapy was given in 36 patients, while 24 patients were treated with both involved-field and elective-field (chest wall and regional lymphatics) locoregional irradiation. Adjuvant systemic therapy con-sisting of either tamoxifen, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or both, along with the recurrent tumor, had been applied in 68.3% of patients. \\t \\nResults : With a median follow-up of 51.5 months, the 4-year actuarial overall survival (OS) after ILRR was 67% for patients with chest wall recurrence. Patients with either axillary, supra- or infraclavicular- recurrence had a 4-year OS of 56%. The 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) for chest wall recurrence and either axillary, supra- or infra-clavicular- recurrence was 56% and 52%, respectively. Seventy-six percent of patients \\t \\nwith a disease-free interval of at least 2 years (late relapse) survived 4 years follow-ing ILRR, as compared to 4-year OS of 39% in those with disease-free interval of less than 2 years (early relapse) (P = .04). The incidence of second ILRR was 8.3% with both involved- and elective-field locoregional irradiation as compared to 22.2% with \\ufeffinvolved-field irradiation alone. Patients who were treated with both involved-field and \\t \\nelective-field locoregional irradiation had the 4-year OS of 69%, and the 4-year DFS of 57%, compared to 55% and 48% of those who were treated with involved-field radiation alone (OS, P = .21; DFS, P = .24). Furthermore, 64% patients who had been treated with adjuvant systemic therapy survived 4 years following ILRR, as compared to 43% for those without additional systemic therapy (P = .08). Similarly, recurrent patients \\t \\nwith adjuvant systemic therapy experienced a 4-year DFS of 60%, compared with 33% for patients without systemic therapy after ILRR (P = .38) Conclusion : A substantial portion of postmastectomy patients with locoregional recur-rence sustain an unexpected long DFS and OS after curative therapy. Therefore, com-prehensive radiotherapy should be used to provide optimal locoregional control and to prevent secondary dissemination in patients with ILRR.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose : To improve dose homogeneity at the neck junction in head-and-neck cancer radiotherapy, we employ a rotating collimator and compare the differences between it and conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). \\t \\nMaterials and Methods : CT images for 10 head-and-neck cancer patients previously treated with SIHB technique in our clinic were used for this planning study. We generated a new CR IMRT in each case and compared the differences between the conformity index and homogeneity index. The new planning technique also used beams with equally-spaced gantry angles but only for the neck above the shoulder. We made beams above the shoulder with a slightly lower field border (normally 3 to 5 mm), to have a built-in feathering. Three of the nine beams treated the entire neck, including the lower neck and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Only three beams are required to split and therefore the total number of fields is 12. The AAPM TG-40 recommended an accuracy of field size and jaw symmetry calibration to be within 2 mm. Hence, for an accelerator operating within these guidelines, \\t \\ntwo abutting fields can overlap or gap up to 2 mm. Field mismatches of ±1 mm and ±2 mm because of imperfect jaw/MLC calibration were simulated. We used film to measure junction inhomogenity. \\t \\nResults : The new technique could be used to successfully generate IMRT plans for head and neck cancers. Both conventional IMRT and CR IMRT had almost the same conformity index and \\t \\nhomogeneity index. Upon evaluating the dose distribution of critical organs, we found all of them were within the tolerance ranges. Film measurements showed that dose inhomogeneities that resulted from 1 mm, 2 mm, 4 mm junction area as jaw/MLC calibration errors were reduced from as large as ±12%, \\t \\n±22%, ±41% with the single-isocenter and half-beam (SIHB) technique to less than ±6% 、±8%, ±12% with this newly developed technique. \\t \\nConclusion : Compared with the conventional SIHB technique, the new technique provides superior dose homogeneity in the abutment region between the supraclavicular and head-and-neck IMRT \\t \\nfields. With a modulating lower border of fields, the feathering mechanism substantially reduces \\ufeffdose inhomogeneities that result from imperfect jaw/MLC calibration.'},\n",

When using a posterior-anterior beam, radiation normally passes through the treatment couch insert of the linear accelerator and the immobilization devices. With high energy photon beam \\t \\nattenuated by the couch insert and immobilization devices, the skin sparing effect will be reduced. \\t \\nThis study is to investigate the dosimetric changes in the Superficial layer dose of the treated object after high energy photon beam passes through the treatment couch (Perspex) insert and immobilization devices. \\t \\nMaterials and Methods : The gantry angle was set as 180°, so that the posterior-anterior photon beam incidents to the couch insert. Measurements were taken for the different combinations of the couch insert and vacuums with 4 beam sizes: 10 × 10 cm2, 15 × 15 cm2, 20 × 20 cm2, and 25 × 25 cm2 . \\t \\nResults : The thicker the vacuum, the larger increase in the Superficial layer dose. The proportion of Superficial layer dose increase was relative larger with smaller field size. There was significant influence of the dose from the couch insert. The magnitude of the influence was relative larger with \\t \\nsmaller field size. The Superficial layer dose with couch insert was 191% of the one with none of each other at the 10 × 10 cm2 field size. The Superficial layer dose with couch insert was 161% of the one with none of them at the 25 × 25 cm2 field size.\\nConclusion : The uses of the couch inert and immobilization devices cause the increased Superficial layer dose. Special considerations need to be taken in these conditions for the possible radiation related skin injury. The impact should be incorporated into the treatment design.'},\n",

This study is to evaluate the short-term outcome and treatment-related toxicity of the TMT for bladder preservation.\\nMaterials and Methods: From 2000 to 2004, 37 patients with invasive bladder TCC undergoing bladder preservation therapy were reviewed retrospectively. Among them, 21 patients received radical TUR-BT followed by RT alone. The other 16 patients who had complete response or good partial response after radical TUR-BT and neoadjuvant CHT received further RT or concurrent chemoradiation. The RT protocol was 45Gy to small pelvis field and 50.4Gy to whole bladder, plus tumor bed boost to a total dose of 64.8Gy with daily fraction size of 1.8Gy in the TMT group. Patients in the RT alone group received 60Gy to whole bladder or 40Gy to whole pelvis plus 20Gy boost to whole bladder with daily fraction size of 2.0 Gy. Interval cystoscopy was performed to confirm the status of complete response for continuation of RT in the TMT group.\\nResults: The median age was 61.8 in the TMT group and 76.8 in the RT alone group. Thirty patients were male and seven were female. In the TMT group, fourteen patients had complete response after radical TUR-BT and induction CHT. Seven patients (43.7%) in the TMT group had grade 3 or 4 acute toxicity, and two of them died of treatment toxicity. The other five patients completed their treatment course with modification of CHT. In the RT alone group, only one patient (4.7%) had grade 3 acute toxicity. The median follow-up was 14.6 months in the TMT group and 21 months in the RT alone group. In the 14 patients completing TMT, two patients experienced local recurrence and none of 16 patients had distant metastasis. In the RT alone group, eight of 21 patients had local recurrence while 7 patients had distant metastasis. The one-year locoregional control rates were 93.3% in TMT group and 72.0% in RT alone group (p=0.11).

The primary tumor was in the nasopharynx in 6, oropharynx in 6, and oral cavity in 4. Radiotherapy (RT) was administered to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes at a dose of 64.8 to 72Gy over 7 to 8 weeks. Chemotherapy consisted of 6 weekly doses of cisplatin (30 mg/m^2) given approximately\\n1 hour prior to RT. A rapid 3-minute intravenous infusion of amifostine, 300 mg/m^2, was given 15 minutes before each RT fraction. All patients were examined at the end of each week.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To determine the RBE of the BNCT epithermal neutron beam produced at THOR for a reference biological system and reference irradiation conditions.\\nMaterials and Methods: Intestinal crypt regeneration in mice was chosen as biological system. No boron compound was administrated. RBE was determined relative to cobalt-60 gamma rays for two irradiation conditions corresponding to different gamma and ”non-gamma” absorbed dose mixtures.\\nResults: The RBE(subscript beam) (i.e. considering the beam ”as it is”, with all dose components and its actual dose rate) was found equal to 1.5 and 1.9 for absorbed dose mixtures comprising 75 and 70% of gamma respectively. Assuming that the RBE of the gamma dose component is equal to unity and deriving the RBE of the non-gamma dose component, RBE(subscript non-γ) values of 2.9 and 4.0 were obtained from the data of the first and second absorbed dose mixture respectively. Comparing the THOR data with those obtained from the same system in 6 other BNCT facilities worldwide, large differences between the RBE(subscript beam) are observed, even when comparing those beam configurations exhibiting similar absorbed dose mixtures. There is, however, a general trend for the RBE(subscript beam) to increase slightly with increasing non-gamma dose component contribution. The derived RBE(subscript non-γ) exhibit also large differences, but average 3.4, which value is close to the one currently apply in clinical practice for determining the ”total biologically weighted dose”.\\nDiscussion and Conclusion: The THOR data as well as those of the other facilities exhibit a certain degree of internal consistency in that the RBE(subscript beam) increases with the non-gamma dose component. However, the RBE differences between institutions appear too large to be explained only by the difference in the composition of the beams and in dose rate (power of the reactor). It is likely that lessening the dosimetric uncertainties and adopting common dosimetric protocols would restore some homogeneity in the radiobiological data. As such experiments constitue an overall check of the irradiation procedure (including dosimetry), they should be undertaken for the commissioning of new installations or on the occasion of any substantial upgrade.'},\n",

This 65-year-old male patient had an initial complaint of persistent cough with blood-tinged sputum for 3 months, and associated symptoms were progressive shortness of breath and body weight loss. Because the patient's chest x-ray revealed right pleural effusion, the initial impression was lung cancer. A chest CT scan was performed and revealed a right infrahilar mass with atelectasis of the right lower lung, and a small nodular density in the right upper anterior lung segment. The final diagnosis of the CT scan was lung cancer of the right lower bronchus with atelectasis and right pleural effusion. A repeat chest PA after pleural fluid drainage revealed thickening of the right visceral and parietal pleurae. A thoracotomy with a pleural biopsy was performed 2 weeks after the CT scan. The pathology revealed an epithelial-type well-differentiated malignant mesothelioma; CK and EMA stains were positive, while CEA stain was negative. The TNM staging was T2N1M0. Radiotherapy was then arranged for this patient. A CT scan of the entire chest cavity in 5-mm slices was performed prior to radiotherapy for treatment simulation with a GE lightspeed scanner. Radiotherapy treatment planning was done with the Eclipse RTP system, version 6.5. Intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was given to the entire right visceral and parietal pleurae for a total dose of 64.6Gy in 38 fractions over a 61-day period from Febuary 12 to April 22, 2003. The patient also received a course of chemotherapy with 100 mg cisplatin iv given 4 days before the start of radiotherapy.\\nResults: The patient, who was followed-up in the outpatient clinic every month, had suffered no local recurrence by 6 months after radiotherapy, and a follow-up CT scan showed slight pleural effusion with progressive regression of the right pleural cavity. The patient suffered a brain metastasis in October 2003. Palliative radiotherapy for the entire brain was given from October 18 to November 20, 2003 for a total dose of 42.5Gy. The patient unexpectedly expired on November 30, 2003.\\nConclusions: IMRT is an alternative treatment option for a malignant mesothelioma which is otherwise unsuitable for a radical extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP). No severe radiation-induced pneumonitis was noted even with the high dose of IMRT. More clinical trials are needed to determine the benefit of this new treatment modality.\"},\n",

It showed that both laboratories had good agreement in measurement results. For the 5 types of cavity ionization chambers used by the 13 dosmetic hospitals, the ratios of the absorbed dose to water calibration coefficient against the air kerma calibration coefficient in 60Co were between 1.094 and 1.105, showing similar results within tight limits (envelop of ±0.6%), At the same time, for all the 13 participants, the measurement differences of the absorbed dose to water for 6 MV and 10 MV high-energy photon beams based on the TG-21 and TG-51 dosimetry protocols were less than 1.5%.\\nConclusions: The manufacturers and structures of medical accelerators and ionization chambers will not cause differences in dose measurement either it was TG-51 or TG-21 protocol that had been used.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: This study aimed to develop an advance precision three-dimensional (3-D) image segmentation algorithm to enhance the blurred edges clearly and then introduce the result onto the intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for tumor targeting. This will achieve what physicians usually demand that tumor doses escalation characteristics of IMRT.\\nMaterials and Methods: No doubt the Wavelet method is well known to be one of the best gradient segmentation methods due to its multi-scale and multi-resolution capabilities. We extend the standard Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) into two dimensions. By applying this 2-D DWT algorithm one may develop a new edge detection method. But for practical purposes, we replace the traditional 2-D wavelet functions with a 2-D discrete periodic wavelet transform (2-D DPWT). Finally, by using Daubechies wavelet transform function to form the wavelet masks for convolution operation in image processing, it allows us to detect edges at different scales for segmentation. Linear interpolation and edges linking and thinning algorithm were then used to form 3-D renderings. A proposed algorithm flowchart designed for this precision 3-D treatment targeting was introduced in this paper. Different medical images were used to test the validity of our method. We then compared the results with a traditional region growing segmentation approach to show that our 3-D renderings not only achieved the precision we sought but also has many interesting applications that shall be most useful to the medical practice.\\nResults: Two CT scan data and one MRI data of different medical images were used to verify the validity of our proposed method. One CT scan dataset from a human chest was test first to extract the right lung for feature extraction. Its wavelet segmentation result was shown in the Figs. 3, 4, 5 and the region growing method was also shown for comparison. The second dataset was a CT scan of a female patient with a pituitary tumor in her brain. The size and shape of the tumor, its orientation with the brain, and the position relative to the head are all now clearly seen. Figures 6, 7 clearly demonstrated the results of our segmentation capable of providing an outstanding positioning of the tumor. In the third experiment of an MRI data, we demonstrate how colors were used in our 3-D renderings to enhance the important parts. 3-D reconstruction of the brain in a partial skull is shown in Fig. 10 (d) with different colors to emphasize their relative positions. On all examples of medical images we created, not only desired precision had been achieved, we are also able to create rotation of the objects with transparent effects to obtain its 3-D images of different angles. They will allow physicians to conduct surgery or treatment much more accurately and effectively. Many 3-D images physicians usually only compose by imaginations, now all visible under our 3-D processing. Features are now clearly identified, locations pinned down exactly, and relative orientations are now well understood. These are all vital for radiation therapies.\\nConclusion: The 3-D targeting segmentation we proposed allows physicians to improve the traditional treatments or IMRT much more accurately and effectively. Our precision 3- D wavelet segmentation rendering shall be very useful in practice for medical images. They will play an important role in image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and many other medical applications in the future.'},\n",

       "  'e': \"Purpose: Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) utilizes nonuniform beam profile to provide desired radiation dosage to the tumor volume more accurately. However, the problem of intra-fraction organ motion can cause distortion to the desired beam intensities. This study aims to develop a respiration adaptive technique to toggle the problem of respiratory motion in radiation therapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: A video cue that shows a cyclic moving pattern is shown to the patient to help adjust his respiratory motion. Once the respiratory motion becomes regular, we can predict his respiratory phase during the treatment. The trajectory of the organ due to the respiratory motion can be obtained from the fluoroscopy study. The trajectory is then used to modify the velocities of MLC leaves so that the radiation field is synchronized with organ motion. Once the beam moves with the respiratory motion, the field size can be fixed on the tumor volume and reduce the distortion of dose distribution due to the organ motion.\\nResults and Conclusions: A phantom was built to simulate the respiratory motion. EDR2 films are employed for the measurement of dose distribution. Preliminary results show that modification of MLC can be used to reduce the distortion due to respiration. Visual cue can be used to improve the regularization of respiration. This technique can be applied to clinical cases. The advantage of this Respiration Adaptive IMRT is to eliminate the inaccuracy of the TM field delivery caused from respiration movement without the cost of treatment efficiency. It requires patient's cooperation for regular respiratory motion.\"},\n",

       "  'e': \"Purpose: Adjuvant radiotherapy is a part of the routine care of patients with early breast cancer. However, a subset of patients with left breast cancer has been shown to be at significant risk of cardiac mortality after longer relapse-free survival. This planning study was designed to assess the efficacy of target coverage and cardiac sparing by three intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques compared to three-dimensional tangential radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: Treatment planning study was performed retrospectively on 10 selected left-sided breast cancer patients previously treated by three-dimensional tangential radiotherapy with the prescribed dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. All patients underwent CT scan following their breast conserving surgery. For each patient, plans were generated and compared using dose volume histograms for planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR). Treatment planning was performed using a commercial IMRT system (Eclipse Version 7.1), and the beam fluency was delivered using a step and shoot window leaf sequence and 6-MV beams. Four different radiation techniques were analyzed: (1) 3-dimensional tangential plan (3D), (2) 2-field tangential IMRT plan (2T), (3) 2-field optimized IMRT plan (2O), and (4) 4-field IMRT plan (4I). Doses to the PTV and each OAR were compared using a paired Student's t-test.\\nResults: PTV homogeneity was similar for the four techniques. For all patients, the average part of the PTV receiving a dose between 95 and 107% of the prescribed dose was 96.1%, 97.4%, 96.0% and 97.6% for the 3D, 2T, 2O and 4I plans, respectively. The mean proportion of the heart receiving more than 95/80% of the prescribed dose was 3.4/7.4% for 3D, 2.5/5.8% for 2T, 1.7/4.5% for 2O and 1.2/2.9% for 4I techniques, while the mean proportion of lung receiving more than 20 Gy was 19.6%, 17.5%, 23.9% and 19.3% for the four plans, respectively. When compared to 3D plans, the 41 plans significantly reduced the high dose irradiation volume of heart; however, the irradiated doses to the contralateral breast were increased. The use of IMRT techniques did not increase either V20 Gy of lung or the mean left lung doses.\\nConclusion: Left breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant irradiation in which the heart receiving higher dose should be considered for alternation to IMRT plan. Better cardiac sparing effect is achievable with the use of 4-field IMRT technique without compromising target coverage.\"},\n",

       "  'e': \"Introduction: Splenic irradiation had been applied for many years as a treatment for various hematologic diseases. Its excellent effects, minimal side effects and low-cost make it as a reasonable treatment policy for palliation. We reviewed our experience of splenic irradiation and discussed its efficacy.\\nMaterials and Methods: Thirteen cases received splenic irradiation at our department from January 2000 to August 2004, and twelve cases were eligible for analysis. Diseases included chronic myelogenous leukemia (4), liver cirrhosis (3), anaplastic anemia (2), acute lymphocytic leukemia (1), Hodgkin's lymphoma (1) and idiopathic myelofibrosis (1). Eighteen courses of radiotherapy were delivered. The radiation treatment techniques consisted of two opposed fields of Co60 and 6 or 15 MV photons targeting to the spleen. The cumulative doses ranged from 500 cGy to 2400 cGy with fraction size ranging from 50 to 160 cGy.\\nResults: Good response was observed in four patients (3 cases of CML, 1 case of idiopathic myelofibrosis) and 7 courses of radiotherapy. Partial response was observed in six patients (2 cases were liver cirrhosis, the other 4 cases were CML, ALL, anaplatic anemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma) and 9 courses of radiotherapy. Two patients were not responsive to the treatment, who were suffering from liver cirrhosis and anaplastic anemia, respectively.\\nDiscussion: Splenic irradiation can achieve good palliate effects for splenomegaly resulting from idiopathic myelofibrosis and hematological malignancies, especial CML. In non-malignant diseases, such as liver cirrhosis and anaplastic anemia, the symptom relief provided by splenic irradiation was not as good as for that of the malignant disease. However, it needs further investigation.\"},\n",

The use of verification film is often accompanied by the inconvenience of storing and retrieving. In addition, the importance of using digital images cannot be overemphasized in the modem radiotherapy. We intended to compare digital portal images obtained from computed radiography (CR) system with conventional portal films and the images from electronic portal imaging devices (EPID).\\nMaterials & Methods: The quality of the verification images was based on the contrast of different thickness or density. We took conventional portal films and digital images of a step wedge and an anthropomorphic RANDO Phantom under a 21 EX Varian linear accelerator. Those images were then compared by visual inspection and quantitative analysis method.\\nResults: Based on the step wedge study, CR system could obtain the full gray-scale of images with least MU. In each treatment site (i.e. Head & Neck, Chest & Pelvis), the quality of the CR images was judged to be superior to conventional portal films.\\nConclusion: The operation for the CR system is similar to the tradition verification film. Since they are digital images, they ca be post processed and the anatomic structure can be enhanced in different ways, especially in the lateral fields of pelvis. It provides a better quality of image to verify the accuracy of the treatment position. It seems that the CR system ca provide a better solution for the radiation treatment of cancer.\"},\n",

There were 14 men and 7 women. Patients' age ranged from 17 to 88. Presenting symptoms/signs, tumor extent, treatment modalities, survival time, and disease-free survival time were recorded. Ten patients (48%) were treated with conventional two-dimensional technique and 11 (52%) with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). Patient's performance status was scored with Karnofsky performance scale (KPS). Tumor extent was staged using Kadish system.\\nResults: Of the 21 patients, 2 were Stage A, 3 Stage B, and 16 Stage C. After a mean follow-up time of 35 months, 4 patients are alive with disease and 4 are alive without disease Locoregional failure occurred in 6 patients and distant metastases were noted in 5 patients. Of the 15 initially node-negative patients who did not receive elective neck irradiation, 3 (20%) failed in the neck. Five-year overall survival rate was 42% and 5-year disease free survival rate was 17%. In univariate analysis, age (≦60 vs. ＞60) and KPS (≧80 vs. ＜80) were significant prognostic factors for overall survival (p=0.019, p=0.000, respectively) and disease-free survival (p=0.021, p=0.001, respectively).\\nConclusion: Treatment results in our series are compatible with others. We find that age and KPS are significant prognostic factors in predicting the outcome. Due to relatively high incidence of neck failure, elective neck irradiation seems worthy to be considered in selective patients.\"},\n",

This study was to assess the effectiveness of radiotherapy in the local control and the symptom relief of the CKS.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between August 1994 and November 2004, 48 patients with histologically proven Kaposi's sarcoma were selected for review from the Cancer Registry of National Taiwan University Hospital, eleven patients were both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative and non organ-transplant recipients. These patients received radiotherapy and were eligible for this study. Treatment methods consisted of local radiotherapy using Cobalt-60 teletherapy, megavoltage photon beam or electron beam. The treatment fields, fractionation, and total dose of radiation were determined on the clinical basis.\\nResults: A total of 11 patients (20 lesions) were enrolled into this study. There were 9 men and 2 women, with a mean age of 66 years. Median follow-up for surviving patients ranged from 4 to 44 months (median, 17 months). Target dose ranged from 30 Gy in ten fractions to 40 Gy in twenty fractions, with the exceptions in four lesions (2 patients). The complete response rate was 75% (15 lesions), and the partial response was evident in the remaining lesions. Median free from recurrence interval has not been reached. The 3-month, 6-month and 1.5-year local regional control rates were 95%, 74% and 74%, respectively. Symptom relief was achieved in all patients. Chronic complications including exudative dermatitis and variable degrees of edema were rare and mild.\\nConclusion: With the few late complication of mild edema and hyperpigmentation, local radiotherapy to CKS was well tolerated and effective. These data suggest that the local radiotherapy remains the effective treatment modality for non-HIV related localized classic Kaposi's sarcoma.\"},\n",

       "  'e': 'Dose uniformity is directly related to tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). An ideal situation is one in which a uniform high dose is focused on the tumor target region and normal tissue surrounding the target volume receives minimal radiation. Dose distribution and uniformity must take into account the irregular contours and density changes within the body, especially the head, neck, and breast. A physical wedge has been used to compensate for irregular contours during traditional treatment, but a physical wedge is limited by its fixed angle and size. In addition, it cannot compensate for two dimensions simultaneously. We have developed a two-dimensional dynamic wedge to overcome these limitations.\\nA wedge-shaped dose map was calculated for this study. The dose map was transferred to a fluence map in a CadPlan treatment planning program to generate a multileaf motion file. We created 6 dynamic wedges and verified them by phantom measurements. The maximum differences in the beam profiles between the calculated values and the measured values were 1.8%, 1.7%, and -1.8% when measured for wedges at 45 degrees, 15 degrees, and 38 degrees in the X direction, and -2.6% and -2.3% when measured for wedges at 20 and 30 degrees in the Y direction. The differences between the isodose curves for the two-dimensional dynamic wedges were less than 2% and 2mm. Absolute doses also showed good agreement between calculated and measured values in this study such that all differences were less than 3%.\\nThe two-dimensional dynamic wedge developed in this study may be valuable for simulating isodose curves and can be used for CadPlan treatment planning which is currently used in many hospitals.'},\n",

By using the inverse treatment planning system and mulitileaf collimator, it allows the clinical implementation of highly conformal dose distributions for target coverage and adjacent normal tissues sparing. However, these advances do not come without a risk. The clinical success or failure of each institution's IMRT program depends on the correct delivery of 3D dose distributions calculated by the planning system to the correct location in the patient. The objective of this study is to establish a dose verification procedure for IMRT planning.\\nMaterials and Methods: A Varian 21EX linac with the 120 leaf multileaf collimator operated in 6 MV and 10 MV x-ray modes using dynamic and step and shoot delivery at 300 MU/min was used for all irradiations. Varian Eclipse planning system (Ver. 7.1) was used also. The procedure was designed for 3 steps. Step 1. Hybridize the patient plan to a solid water phantom using the ”create verification plan” in the Eclipse. Step 2. Recalculate the dose distribution in the phantom. Find area of low dose gradient and select points in this area for point dose verification. 2D dose distribution at isocenter for each portal are calculated for comparison. Step 3. The phantom is then irradiated according to this plan. The point doses are measured using CC01 ion chamber and the 2D dose distributions are measured using Kodak XV film or EDR2 film. Kodak LS75 laser scanner and DoseLab film analysis system are used for 2D dose comparison.\\nResults: The variations of point dose of 124 patients are within 6%. The calculated dose distributions are consistent to the measurements for the 2D dose comparison.\\nConclusions: CC01 chamber is suitable for IMRT point dose verification. Film dosimetry system in this study can be used for IMRT 2D dose distribution comparison. IMRT dose verification can be done by this procedure.\"},\n",

The most common sites were lung (41.7%) and bone (44.4%). The 3-year OS rate was 54%. The overall 3-year DFS rate was 31.7%. The overall 3-year LRFS rate was 50.8%. The overall 3-year DMFS rate was 34.9%. The 3-year OS for single site and multiple site recurrence was 60.4% and 20% (p=0.02), while the 3-year OS for small recurrent tumor (＜=3cm) and large tumor/multiple lesions was 71.9% and 35.5%, respectively (p＜0.01). Analysis of initial nodal status revealed that the 3-year OS for patients with no node metastasis was 78.6% and that for patients with positive node metastasis was 46.9% (p=0.04). In addition, the 3-year OS for patients with long latent period (＞24 months) and short latent period was 81.5% and 33.3% (p＜0.01), respectively. The 3-year OS for patients with and without surgery for recurrent tumor was 63.8% and 25% (p＜0.01), respectively.\\nConclusion: Salvage radiotherapy is effective in achieving satisfactory local control in patients with early stage disease and no lymph node metastasis who developed LRR. For patients with multiple or large recurrent tumors, as well as advanced initial lymph node metastasis, it is imperative to incorporate more aggressive systemic treatment to improve treatment outcome.'},\n",

Study eligibility required that the patients had pathologically-proven small cell carcinoma in sites other than the lung, a normal chest radiograph and/or computed tomography of the chest, and a normal sputum cytology or negative bronchoscopic findings at diagnosis. The medical records of each patient were reviewed retrospectively and clinical outcomes were compared.\\nResults: Primary sites of EPSCCA in our series included: 7 patients in the gynecological system, 6 in head and neck regions, 3 in urinary bladder, 3 in the gastrointestinal system, 1 in the breast, and 1 in the infra-clavicular soft tissue. Five patients had extended disease (ED) and 16 had limited disease (LD) at initial work-up. RT was delivered to 11 of 16 patients with LD as part of the initial primary therapy, and to 5 with relapse or metastasis as salvage or palliation. The 2-year overall survival for ED and LD EPSCCA were 0% and 49.2%, respectively. During follow-up, a total of 17 (81%) of the 21 patients developed distant metastases. There was a 60% response rate for those patients with ED at diagnosis or LD with relapse or metastasis when RT initiated. For the 11 patients with LD and receiving RT as part of the initial primary therapy, one of six patients receiving surgery followed by adjuvant RT (with or without chemotherapy) developed local recurrence. The remaining five who received RT alone or chemotherapy and RT had a 100% response rate. However, four of them developed local relapses at a median duration of 8 months. The 2-year local relapse-free and disease-free survivals for patients with LD were 53% and 27%, respectively.\\nConclusion: EPSCCA was sensitive to radiotherapy. Easily distant metastasis and local recurrence of the disease warrant more aggressive combination therapy.\"},\n",

TTS-fentanyl was given with the initial dose of 25 μg/h when severe mucositis pain (numeric rating scale [NRS]≧7) occurred in spite of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and topical steroidal ointment use. The pain intensity was assessed every week and if severe pain persisted, another dose of 25 μg/h TTS-fentanyl was given. The adverse effects were recorded every week according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 2.0.\\nResults: From October 2002 to March 2003, 21 male and 1 female receiving CCRT with HNC were recruited to this study. The mean NRS for pain significantly decreased from 7.65±0.99 (baseline) to 3.9±1.29 within the first week. In the fifth week, the NRS raised to 4.79±1.18 but was still lower than the baseline (p=0.003). The sufficient analgesia was achieved in 15 cases with a dose of 25 μg/h, in 5 cases with a dose of 50 μg/h, and in 1 case with a dose of 100 μg/h. One patient withdrew the TTS-fentanyl due to intolerable skin rash and vomiting in the second week. Besides, no one developed respiratory depression, mental clouding, or grade Ⅲ/IV gatrointestinal toxicities.\\nConclusion: TTS-fentanyl is effective and safe in the treatment of mucositis-induced pain which is resistant to NSAID in HNC patients receiving CCRT. TTS-fentanyl also spares the need to swallow pain killers in these patients suffering from odynophagia and/or dysphagia, as well as the time for titration of conventional analgesic drugs. Further larger series with randomized setting is warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TTS-fentanyl for oral mucositis pain.'},\n",

No adjuvant chemotherapy was applied. All patients were irradiated locally after 3-dimensional conformal treatment planning. There were 4 patients who received 2 courses of radiation therapy to the same region of the brain for tumor recurrence, in which the first course was hyperfractionated treatment and the second course were either hyperfractionation or conventional fractionation. Patient and tumor factors were investigated for survival differences using Kaplan-Meier method and Log-Rank test. These include age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Score, tumor maximum diameter, and types of surgery.\\nResults: Median survival of our 27 patients was 12 months, with 1 year and 2-year survival probabilities of 44% and 19%, respectively. The group of patients who received two full courses of radiation treatment did fairly well in survival ranged 12 to 41 months. Patients with Karnofsky Performance Score equal or greater than 70 had longer median survival than patients less than 70 (12 months and 10 months, respectively). This difference is statistically significant (p=0.0443). Although patients younger than 55 years seemed to do better than those older or equal to 55 years (median survival of 13 months versus 11 months), no significant survival difference was noted. Patients who received total resection had better median survival (12 months) than patients who received inadequate resection (7 months), but this difference did not reach statistical significance either. Other tumor or patient factors showed no survival difference.\\nConclusion: The advantage of hyperfractionation radiation treatment is to escalate total tumor dose without increasing toxicity in normal tissues. Total dose of 72 Gy is well tolerated by glioblastoma multiform patients given in hyperfractionated fashion. Overall survival rate and median survival of our patients are comparable to other studies of altered fractionation treatment regime. Karnofsky Performance Score is the most important prognostic factors in our study.'},\n",

Previous analysis of the two types of digitizers by ROC (receiver operator characteristics) method has shown no significant differences.

Two digitizers were used to digitize those films. One digitizer was the Vidar VXR-12 PLUS with fluorescent light source and the other was Lumiscan-50 with laser beam source.\\nTest films were made in order to investigate their warm-up effect, signal-to-noise ratio, percentage standard deviation, optical density range, transmission artifact and Moiré artifacts. Those features might be affected when films were converted into corresponding value through the above-mentioned digitizers.\\nResults: Varying in O.D. range influence the feature of signal-to-noise ratio, percentage standard deviation, and transmitting capacity that performed by digitizers. The digitizer with a laser beam source was shown more stable in such circumstances. On the other hand, the digitizer with a broadband fluorescent light source had a minor transmission artifact and no Moiré artifacts than the previous one.\\nConclusions: Selection of a digitizer for film dosimetry depends on what kind of data one would want to acquire. A fluorescence light digitizer has a higher spatial resolution and is more suitable for radiation field-light field coincident and star shoot check. On the other hand, a laser beam digitizer offers wilder dose range and less noise.\"},\n",

According to the ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status scaling system, 3 patients (11%) were ECOG 0, 20 patients (74%) were ECOG 1, and 4 patients (15%) were ECOG 2. The treatments consisted of either concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. Chemotherapy regimens were cisplatin and etoposide. The median thoracic irradiation dose was 55.8 Gy (range: 45-64.8 Gy).\\nResults: There were 15 patients (55%) achieving complete response, and 4 patients (15%) having partial response, with a total local response rate of 70%. Only one patient (7%) had local relapse out of 15 patients with complete tumor response. A total of 14 patients achieved local regional control (52%, 14 out of total 27 patients). Thirteen patients (48%) had distant metastasis, and 9 patients (69%) died of their diseases during the follow-up periods. The mean survival time was 28 months. In survival analysis, the 1- year, 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 67%, 54% and 43%, respectively. The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 68%, 36% and 22%, respectively. The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 67%, 58% and 46%, respectively. In prognostic factors analysis, cumulative irradiation dose (p=0.018) was a predictor for local response. Body weight loss (p=0.010), cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.007) and local response (p=0.032) were prognostic factors for overall survival. Body weight loss (p=0.037), cycles of chemotherapy (p=0.001) and distant metastasis (p=0.001) were prognostic factors for disease-free survival.

Statistical methods have been employed to analyze overall survival and local-control rates of these cases, and to identify the correlations between different panameters such as the presenting symptoms and signs, surgical findings, radiotherapy (RT) dose, and the RT modality.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between 1985 and 2003, the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, had 228 patients with bile duct cancer referred for RT. Only the 78 patients with no distant organ metastases who underwent treatment for localized biliary system lesions were included in this study. Five patients received intra-luminal RT (ILRT) alone, 15 had external beam RT (EBRT) plus\\nILRT, and 58 patients received EBRT alone. Statistical methods were employed to identify factors that affected overall survival and local-control rates. These factors include patients’ presenting symptoms and signs (jaundice and pain), a past history of hepatobiliary disease, pre-operative performance status (Karnofsky score), surgical findings (lymph node, perineural, and portal vein involvement), histological and pathological classification, CEA level, the radiation modality and the radiation dose.\\nResults : The follow-up periods ranged from 1-160 months (median 17 months). The 78 patients had a 5-year overall survival rate of 11.3% after RT, and the median survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 4.4- 9.9 months). Peri-neural and lymph node involvement, poor performance status, presence of pain and/ or jaundice, poorly differentiated histology, single RT modality and lower radiation doses were factors that correlated negatively with\\nsurvival. The local control rate was most significantly affected by the presence of residual disease prior to RT.\\nConclusion: Higher doses RT offers a better survival to patients with bile duct cancers. The benefit of ILRT given alone remains unclear. Since residual disease appears to be critical for local control, complete resection of the tumor is essential; which reinforces the importance of early diagnosis of bile duct cancer.'},\n",

The Dmax shifts towards the surface as the electron beam field size reduced. The smaller the field sizes, the greater the surface dose, and the dose fall-off region becomes more gradual. If the mean size of arterio-venous fistula is 1.5 cm in length and 5mm in width, the safe margin should add 8mm more for long and short axis to cover treatment target adequately. The closer between cerrobend blocks and skin, the better the dose distribution will be.\\nConclusion : The dialysis accesses (arterio-venous fistula) are suitable for electron-beam therapy because of their superficial location. The electron fields for arterio-venous fistula are usually small and elongated, dose distribution are usually unpredictable by conventional calculation table. The study provides a practical reference dose system for small and elongated field size electron beam dose calculation not only for arterio-venous fistula therapy, but also for skin, head and neck area treatment.'},\n",

The detectors were positioned on the patient’s skin and behind the patient. Then, the entrance or exit dose was measured with appropriate correction factors (taking field size, wedge and block into account), and by combining the two dose mentioned above, the dose inside the patient was obtained using transmission curve. In external radiotherapy for head and neck patients where a very accurate dose delivery to the tumor is required, the experimental and prescribed midline dose values were compared.\\nResults : From measurements obtained for external radiotherapy for head and neck patients, 8.96% of the diodes measurements showed a discrepancy more than 5% when compared with prescribed dose, while 43.28% was detected from TLDs. Difference of 10% or more were found in 4.47% of the TLDs measurements.\\nConclusion : In this study we report on our experience with in vivo dosimetry. It shows that systematic in vivo dosimetry is a valid tool for quality assurance. Cancer centers can define an appropriate action level concerning the deviation between measured and prescribed dose; if the action level is exceeded, treatment parameters have to be checked and generally, in vivo dosimetry has to be repeated until the cause of the deviation is found and, if possible, eliminated.'},\n",

Material and Method : Between April 1991 to December 2000, 130 patients with FIGO IB to IIA carcinoma of the cervix were treated with radical hysterectomy, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and postoperative radiation therapy. Nineteen patients received systemic chemotherapy. All the patients had at least one of the following pathologic risk factors: 1. positive pelvic nodal metastasis, 2. multiple positive lymph nodes, 3. parametrial invasion, 4. vascular space invasion, 5. positive surgical margin, 6. bulky tumor size ＞ 4 cm, 7. multiple pathologic risk factors. The radiation dose delivered to the whole pelvis range from 41-54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions. One hundred twenty-four patients received 2.5-21.5 Gy intracavitary brachytherapy. Results : The patients were followed for a median of 57.9 months (range: 4.1 - 129.9). The 5-year overall survival and disease free survival rate were 76.5% and 76.1%, respectively. A total of 29 (22.3%) patients developed recurrence. Six recurrences were in the pelvis alone. Sixteen patients recurred only at sites outside the pelvis. Seven patients had both pelvic and distant recurrences. We demonstrated that only vascular space invasion had significant effect on disease free survival by univariate analysis (p = 0.05). Vascular space invasion and multiple pathologic risk factors were significantly correlated with higher incidence of distant metastasis. (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively). In multivariate analysis of these factors showed that only vascular space invasion remained significant risk factors (p = 0.05). Therapeutic complications occurred in 20 (15%) patients, including gastrointestinal in 12 (9%) patients or genitourinary in 8 (6%) patients. The overall 5-year complication-free rate was 91%. Ten (8%) of those patients had grade 3 and 4 late morbidity. Conclusion : Our study suggested that postoperative radiotherapy after radical hysterectomy give reasonable survival in early stage carcinoma of the cervix. Poor survival and higher incidence of distant metastasis were observed if presence of vascular space invasion or multiple pathologic risk factors.'},\n",

This retrospective study is to report our result in treating pancreatic cancer with radiotherapy. Material and Methods : From 1992 to June 2002, 32 patients with tissue-proven neoplasms of the pancreas were treated with external-beam radiotherapy to a dose of 45 to 64 Gy (median, 50.4 Gy). Eight patients with resectable tumors received post-operative radiotherapy for margin or node positive. Eight had initial metastatic disease in the liver, lung or neck lymph nodes. The remaining 16 patients had unresectable, locally advanced tumors. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type (28 patients), followed by neuroendocrine tumor (2), cystadenocarcinoma (1) and mucinous carcinoma (1). Chemotherapy with 5-FU or gemcitabine base was given to 28 (88%) patients, most concurrently. Result : The overall survival rate for all patients was 31.3% at 1 year and 10.7% at 2 years. Those with adenocarcinomas had a poorer survival than those with non-adenocarcinomatous tumors (median: 7.6 vs. 22.2 months, P = 0.04). Among the 28 adenocarcinoma patients, survival was significantly better for those with resectable tumors, as compared to unresectable and metastatic tumors (median: 10.9 vs. 8.3 vs. 2.8 months, P = 0.0003). The liver was the most common site of distant metastasis in 11 patients (35%). Conclusion : Despite the relatively favorable prognosis of radiotherapy for resectable compared with unresectable and metastatic pancreatic cancers, the survival of patients after radiotherapy is still dismal. New approaches using novel agents and combined treatment modalities are necessary to change the dismal outlook of the disease.'},\n",

Materials and Methods : We conducted a retrospective analysis of 78 patients with pathologically staged LAEC (TxN1, T3-4Nx) with adjuvant CRT after surgery between January 1990 and December 1998. Patients received curative esophagectomy as the primary treatment. Four weeks later, patients received adjuvant CRT at 1.8 Gy/fraction and infusional chemotherapy (1-2 cycles) with regimens of cisplatin 20 mg/m2, fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, leucovorin 90 mg/m2 during radiotherapy. The patients were divided into two groups with the total doses of 40-49.99 Gy (low-dose) for AJCC stage II and over 50 Gy (standard-dose) for stage III.  Results : Twenty-five patients received low-dose radiotherapy and 53 patients received standard-dose radiotherapy. Five-year overall survival rate was 40.00% and 28.30% for the low- and standard- dose group (p = 0.43). Five-year disease-free survival rate was 28.00% (low-dose) and 24.53% (standard-dose) (p = 0.36). Five-year local recurrence-free survival rate was 40.00% and 28.30 % (p = 0.44). Five-year distal metastasis-free survival rate was 38.77% and 24.53 % (p = 0.61). There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups.

Clinical xerostomia of Grade I was noted in 9 patients, Grade II in 9, and Grade III in one. There was a significant difference between the pre- and post-irradiation parotid gland SR (p= 0.002). Poor prognostic factors for the preservation of parotid gland function were N (+) Stage (p= 0.03), median dose of parotid gland greater than 35 Gy (p = 0.038), 50% volume of parotid gland greater than 35 Gy (p = 0.032) and the habit of betel quid chewing for longer than 5 years (p = 0.029).  Conclusions :This study demonstrated that the combination of IMRT and chemotherapy is an effective and safe method for the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer. The N stage, median dose of parotid gland, 50% volume dose to the parotid glands and the habit of betel quid chewing were correlated with post-irradiated parotid gland function.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose : It has been shown that concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) confers significantly better survival in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) compared with radiotherapy. We conducted a prospective pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a CCRT regimen using low-dose cisplatin (CDDP) for treatment of NPC to see if it enhanced radiation response and reduced chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Materials and Methods : A total of 14 patients were enrolled. The CCRT regimen consisted of radiotherapy (RT), 70~72 Gy to the primary tumor with concurrent CDDP 30 mg/m2 administered once a week for 7 to 8 weekly doses. After CCRT, 4 cycles of adjuvant CDDP, 20 mg/m2/day, and 5-FU, 1000 mg/m2 infused over 24 hours for 5 consecutive days were given monthly. Tumor response and toxicity were analyzed. Results : Eleven patients completed CCRT in 8 to 10 weeks, 3 patients delayed up to eleven weeks, and half (50%) received 4 complete courses of adjuvant chemotherapy. Ten (71.4%) patients had a complete response (CR) after CCRT, with an additional 3 achieving a CR after adjuvant chemotherapy, for a total of 13 (92.9%) out of 14. Adverse effects of CCRT included grade 3 or 4 oropharyngeal mucositis in 3 (21.4%) and grade 3 or 4 radiation dermatitis in 8 (57.1%). There was no severe renal or fatal toxicity from the treatment. At a median follow-up of 19.5 months, 1 patient still had residual tumor, 1 had recurrence and 2 had systemic metastases. Conclusion : CCRT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy was effective in a small series of NPC patients, with acceptable and reversible acute toxicity. This protocol deserves further investigation in randomized prospective trials.'},\n",

The aim of our study is to evaluate the outcome and analyze prognostic factors in patients with DCIS of breast treated with partial mastectomy and radiation therapy. Materials and Methods : From December 1992 through July 2003, there were 29 women diagnosed with DCIS of breast receiving the treatment of partial mastectomy and radiation therapy at our institution. The median age of diagnosis was 46 years. The median tumor size was 2.0 cm. The tumor was predominantly at left-side breast (66%), and the outer upper quadrant was the main location (59%). Sentinel axillary lymph node biopsy was performed in 8 patients (28%). The resection margin was free in 14 patients (48%), and positive in 6 patients (21%). The subtypes of pathological report were comedo type in 13 patients (45%), papillary type in 4 patients (14%), cribriform type in 3 patients (10%), solid type in 2 patients (7%), and not specified in 7 patients (24%). Ten patients had high-grade DCIS (35%). Necrosis of tumor was found in 16 patients (55%). The median radiation dose to the breast was 46Gy. The median dose of tumor bed boost was 16Gy. After completion of radiation therapy, hormone therapy with tamoxifen 10mg twice daily was administered to 13 patients (45%). Results : All 29 patients were alive until the latest follow-up. The median duration of follow-up was 25 months (range: 3 to 127 months). Among 28 patients without any regional recurrence or distant metastasis, 11 patients survived for more than 30 months. Only one out of 29 patient (3%) had regional recurrence after follow-up for 4.5 years. Three-year overall survival rate was 100%, and five-year overall survival rate was 100%. Three-year disease free survival rate was 100%, and five-year disease free survival rate was 80%. Three-year disease specific survival rate was 100%, and three-year disease specific survival rate was 100%. Twenty-five patients (86%) had excellent cosmetic results, and 4 patients (14%) had good cosmetic results. In univariate analysis of variables with log rank test, tumor necrosis, tumor grade, and resection margin were significant in predicting disease free survival. Conclusion : The good survival outcome and low local recurrence rate suggested the treatment with partial mastectomy and radiation therapy was a good option of treatment for DCIS of breast. Tumor necrosis, tumor grade, and resection margin were prognostic factors on disease free survival. Larger study series with longer follow-up period should be warranted to make advanced analysis in patients with DCIS receiving treatments of partial mastectomy and radiation therapy.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose : Tracheal malignancy was not often seen in clinical practice. Its prevalence was about 0.2-0.5% of all respiratory tract malignancies, with 1:100 ratio of tracheal to bronchial tumors in reported series. Prognosis of patients with tumor of the trachea remains poor. The treatment choice for early stage disease is surgery because extensive resection provides better control. For patients with advanced stage disease definitive radiotherapy has shown modest gain. Several studies have demonstrated the value of radiotherapy in controlling primary tumor in the trachea.  Material and Method : From 1985 to 2000, there were twelve patients with primary tracheal malignancy found in Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Seven patients were squamous cell carcinoma, three were adenoid cystic carcinoma, one was melanoma and one was neuroendocrine carcinoma. Among them, two patients?details were not available anymore. One died of surgical complication within two months after resection. Thus nine of ten evaluable patients entered into the analysis of possible prognostic factors for primary tracheal malignancy. Univariate analyses of prognostic factors were carried out by Kaplan-Meier log rank method.  Results : Seven of ten evaluable patients received definitive radiotherapy as curative purpose and one for palliation. The estimated median survival time for all ten patients was 33 months (CI: 0~66 months), with the survival rate at one and two years being 70% and 60%. Local invasion and duration of initial symptoms were possible significant prognostic factors for poor survival. Besides, we also identified the same factors as the possible significant prognostic factors for disease-free survival time. Local lymph node involvement and histological type of cancer showed effects in both survival and disease-free survival but didn掐 reach the significant level. Conclusion : From our experience, radiotherapy either as a curative or palliative purpose seems to be safe and effective for tracheal cancer. However, due to rarity of primary tracheal malignancy, there was small group in our series. We offered our experience of radiotherapy for tracheal cancer and discuss possible prognostic factors, although less statistic meanings.'},\n",

Primary central nervous system sarcomas are rare and account for only 1.5% of all intracranial tumors. These tumors are thought to arise from mesenchymal elements within the brain parenchyma or its meningeal coverings. Histopathologically, the most common tumor types included malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, leimyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma. Primary central nervous system fibrosarcomas are usually of high histological grade, with a high rate of recurrence. Their propensity for meningeal and distant relapse distinguishes them from tumors of glial origin. The rare occurrence of primary central nervous system fibrosarcomas leads to a paucity of data in the literature and experience regarding the therapeutic management of these tumors. Because soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive tumors capable of local recurrence and distant metastasis, the need for a multidisciplinary approach is indicated in treating these tumors. As for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity and trunk, the mainstay of treatment of primary central nervous system sarcomas is surgical excision. While brain surgery must be limited due to the proximity of critical structures, en bloc resections cannot be achieved and adjuvant radiotherapy should be given to control residual disease. We report a case of 30-year-old man who had primary central nervous system fibrosarcoma over left frontal lobe with presentation of progressive right-sided numbness and weakness. The patient was treated with total excision of the tumor followed by adjuvant radiotherapy via cone-down wedged-pair technique.

       "  'c': '目的：唾液腺具極高之輻射敏感度，鼻咽癌病人接受放射治療後，唾液腺遭破壞，造成病人之唾液分泌大幅降低。如何在放射治療過程中保護唾液腺，方法之一是使用能減低唾液輻射傷害的保護劑如pentoxifylline、amifostine等。此外有許多藥物可能具唾液保護的效果如維它命C、腎上腺素激性藥物（adrenergic agonist）及膽素刺激性（cholinergic）藥物。本研究使用解剖、生理與人類近似之迷你豬，目的為1. 建立迷你豬唾液腺研究的動物模式。2. 測試篩選能有效刺激迷你豬唾液分泌的最適當方法。3. 得到初步迷你豬腮腺放射反應資料。\\n材料及方法：採用台大畜產所體重約10-15公斤之李宋系迷你豬。經麻醉、插管後，再行唾液收集、藥物注射、放射線照射或手術。唾液刺激採藥物與電刺激方式找出最佳刺激方式。膽素刺激性藥物Carbachol及a-腎上腺素激性藥物Cyclocytidine與Norepinephrine均在測試之列。放射腺照射以6MV直線加速器為之。整個實驗架構如下：一、動物模式建立。建立小豬麻醉方法，選擇唾液刺激方法（神經刺激或藥物刺激），決定唾液收集方法。二、腮腺照射前後之唾液分泌功能。收集未照射前兩側腮腺唾液，右側腮腺照射1000 cGy x 2、300 cGy x 15、與400 cGy x 12後於一週、一個月與四個月時以藥物刺激後，收集唾液比較照射與未照射側腮腺分泌量之變化。\\n結果：經測試Carbachol 0.2 mg/kg最為適當，可刺激唾液大量分泌，且可重複驗證，再現性極佳。但使用carbachol仍可能導致心跳停止，常須進行心臟按摩搶救小豬。此情況於靜注1cc atropine後心跳均可立即恢復。電刺激方式則無法刺激唾液分泌。在唾液收集方面，發現以乾燥2 x 2 cm紗布塞於腮腺唾液管乳頭處之收集法，最為可靠及穩定。經照射1000 cGy x 2後一週及一個月唾液分泌為2.93 ml/min，未照射腮腺分泌量為3.0ml/min。照射4500 cGy與4800 cGy一週及一個月後，未照射之左腮腺及照射之右腮腺唾液分泌量亦無差別。照射4500 cGy與4800 cGy四個月後，未照射與照射腮腺分泌量分別為2.56/1.08與6.83/1.99 ml/min，照射過之腮腺表現明顯分泌量的減少。此時照射後腮腺明顯萎縮，兩隻接受4500 cGy與4800 cGy小豬之未照射與照射側腮腺之重量分別為127.9/26.9克、125.7/22.1克。\\n結論：以迷你豬為材料，取其解剖與生理較大鼠更近似人類，唾液量夠大等優點。惟與大鼠相較，迷你豬成本高出許多，以致實驗規模無法與使用老鼠時相比。本研究建立之動物模式，能可靠重複刺激迷你豬之腮腺唾液分泌。Carbachol為一有效之唾液刺激藥物，但有心臟停止跳動的缺點。相反的Adrenergic類藥物norepinephrine則不用擔心心跳停止，但唾液刺激效率不好，但若提高norepinephrine的劑量能否增強其唾液刺激效果，仍有待進一步研究。唾液腺在人類為早期即出現之反應，但又有晚期反應組織的特色。本研究則發現迷你豬腮腺未出現早期反應，此點發現與人類唾液腺經照射360-720 cGy後即明顯出現唾液分泌降低有顯著差異，其造成之原因有待進一步的研究。本研究之結果將可作為後續動物實驗之基礎，最終希望能用於治療或預防鼻咽癌病人唾液腺傷害之副作用。',\n",
       "  'e': 'Purpose : Salivary glands are extremely radiosensitive organs, and are inevitably destroyed during the course of radiotherapy in NPC patients. One of the possible preventive approaches for radiation-induced salivary gland damage is the use of parotid-protecting drugs including pentoxifylline and amifostine. A few other drugs including adrenergic and cholinergic agonists have been tested for their salivary protection effect. The goals for this study are: 1. To establish an animal model using miniature pigs for study of radiation protection of parotid gland. 2. To find out an effective agent for saliva stimulation. 3. To conduct a preliminary study of radiation effect on parotid gland using this animal model.\\nMethods & Materials : Lee-Song species of miniature pigs 3-4 months old weighing about 10-15 kg were used.  They were anaesthetized and intubated followed by salivary collection, drug stimulation, irradiation or surgery.  Drugs including cholinergic stimulant carbachol, adrenergic agonists cyclocytidine and norepinephrine were tested for their efficacy in saliva-stimulation. Electric stimulation was also tested. The entire study structure was as follows: 1. For animal model establishment: anaesthesia procedure, optimization of salivary gland stimulation (physical and chemical approach), optimization of saliva collection.  2. For dose-response study of parotid glands: parotid secretion of unirradiated pigs, right parotid irradiation with 1000 cGy x 2, 300 cGy x 15, and 400 cGy x 12 and assayed for parotid function 1 week, 1 month and 4 months after completion of irradiation. \\nResults : Carbachol 0.2 mg/kg was most efficient for stimulating salivary secretion in a reproducible way. Yet this drug induced cardiac arrest and cardiac massage was needed sometimes. However, this can be reversed immediately after iv bolus of 1 ml of atropine. For saliva collection, using dry, 2 x 2 inch gauze to suck the secretion proves to be accurate and feasible. One week and 1 month after 1000 cGy x 2 the control versus irradiated parotid secretion is 3.0/2.93 ml/min. The difference between control and irradiated glands was also insignificant 1 week and 1 month after 4500 cGy and 4800 cGy.  However, at 4 months, a marked difference in parotid secretion occurred with the control/irradiated of 2.56/1.08 and 6.83/1.99 ml/min, respectively. At 4 months, the irradiated gland was also markedly atrophic and the weight for control/irradiated parotids in 2 experiments was 127.9/26.9 gm after 4500 cGy and and 125.7/22.1 gm after 4800 cGy, respectively.\\nConclusion : Advantages using minipig as the model include the higher similarity with humans than rodents in terms of physiology and anatomy and the much larger salivary secretion volume. The only disadvantage is the higher cost that limits the sample size of the experiment. The animal model we have established is feasible for salivary stimulation and saliva collection that can be reproduced consistently. Carbachol proves to be very efficient for saliva stimulation and cardiac arrest is the only shortcoming. On the contrary, norepinephrine is less efficient for saliva stimulation but is free of the side effect of cardiac arrest. Salivary gland damage appears acutely in humans and persists for many years after completion of radiotherapy. In contrast to humans, minipig parotid gland did not show an evaluable early effect up to 1 month after radiotherapy. The nature of this discrepancy is interesting and requires further exploration. The result of this study may be used for future experiments aiming at prevention of radiation damage to the parotid glands.'},\n",

However, there still do not have study focused on the changes of fatigue level in patients receiving this treatment.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes of fatigue and hematology index in hepatocellular cancer patients receiving stereotactic radiotherapy. \\nMaterials and methods : Prospective longitudinal research design was developed to examine the changes of fatigue and hematology index during and after stereotactic radiotherapy.  Data were collected from December 2001 to May 2002.  A total of 45 eligible subjects were recruited from two teaching hospitals in Taipei. Five patients were excluded due to expire or dropout from this study.  Forty eligible patients finished the seven weeks study.  Fatigues index were evaluated by questionnaire of Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) which measured the fatigue intensity, fatigue duration and fatigue interference weekly. Hb, Ht, WBC and Platelet were measured weekly for 7 weeks.  Besides, AST, ALT and albumin blood index were measured one week before radiation therapy and at week 2, week 4 and week 6 during treatment. Data were analyzed by SPSS computer program. \\nResults : All the subjects in this study had mild fatigue in the beginning of the treatment.  Their fatigue intensity, fatigue duration and fatigue interference were significantly increased from pre-treatment to the 5th week except the 3rd week. The peak level of fatigue occurred in the 5th week and it decreased since the 6th week (p ＜ 0.01).  Blood Hb, Ht, WBC and platelet level descended gradually to abnormal along with treatment (p ＜ 0.05), but the blood AST and ALT level rise along with the treatment.  Though the blood albumin level decreased, it was in normal range. Nonsignificant correlations between fatigue level and laboratory data were found.\\nConclusion : Fatigue was a commonly experienced problem in hepatocellular cancer patients receiving stereotactic radiotherapy, but the fatigue scores were at minimal level.  Part of the hematology study data change during treatment.  The results of this study can provide the clinical personnel information about the change of fatigue level in hepatocellular cancer patients receiving stereotactic radiotherapy.'},\n",

Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that dark-skinned people are much less susceptible than Caucasians to ultraviolet (UV)-induced skin damage including both non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer. On the other hand, melanin, its intermediates and precursors can generate reactive-oxygen species when irradiated with UV irradiation and have been shown to be effective photosensitizers. \\nThe last decade has witnessed a renewed and unprecedented impetus in melanin research that has significantly expanded our knowledge of this field. Melanin is a highly irregular heteropolymer consisting of monomeric units derived from the enzymatic oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine. There are two distinct types of melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin. Now, it is proved that eumelanins are the main photoprotective pigment in the epidermis and pheomelanins are phototoxic upon irradiation. \\nThe same situation is also true for ionizing radiation that eumelanin not only possesses radiation protective effect but also contains photoprotective ability. Since malignant melanoma is resistant to radiation therapy, therapeutic strategies targeted to the melanogenesis of eumelanin may have potential benefit for the radiation therapy of malignant melanoma.'},\n",

As the electron energy used in the treatment is chosen based on the depth, the underlying normal tissues can be spared more compared to photon beam therapy. Furthermore, electron beam has become frequently employed in total body irradiation to boost chest wall for treatment of bone marrow transplant, leukemia. Hence, radiation therapy using electron beams have shown increasing important role and applications in clinical use. \\nMaterials and Methods : In this study, the effective SSD of different electron energies at various depths were investigated using linear accelerator, parallel plate ion chamber, electrometer and solid water phantom. The dosimetric properties of different electron cones and energies were measured at surface, and maximum, 90%, 80%, 50% dose depth. The dosimetric variations and applications under varied energies and output period were then discussed. \\nResults : The results showed that: the larger the electron cone size and energy, the larger the electron effective SSD. The results of effective SSD measured at maximum, 90%, 80% dose depth showed negligible difference within 2%. The effective SSD measured at surface and 50% dose depth showed a larger difference about +5.04%.\\nConclusions : In general, the central beam axis dose correction for the electron effective SSD applied with inverse square law uses the maximum depth as reference point. In this study, the measurements at different percentage depth dose point were tabulated to clearly state the dosimetry characteristics of electron beams and improve understanding of the dosimetric distributions, thus perfecting the patient treatment plans.'},\n",

The time interval between the primary radiotherapy and salvage GK was 1 to 12 years (median = 2.0 years). All patients received single fraction of Gamma Knife radiosurgery was performed with peripheral doses of 12.5 to 20 Gy (median = 15 Gy) to cover the recurrent tumor as conformal as possible. The tumor volumes (TV) were less than 1 to 33 cc (median = 11cc) whereas radiation volumes (RV) were 6 to 48 cc (median = 20.9 cc). Retrospectively the patients were divided into two groups according to their treatment. Four patients received GK without further radiotherapy (Group A). The other 7 patients received hyperfractionated external beam radiotherapy of 30 to 47 Gy (median = 38 Gy) and concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin, 5-FU, mitomycin C) for further boost of the tumor (Group B).\\nResult : All patients tolerated GK well without significant acute toxicity. The first MRI after GK showed tumor regression for eight out of nine patients receiving this examination. One patient died of sepsis induced by concurrent chemotherapy, not receiving fractionated RT. For the other 3 patients receiving GK without combined RT (group A), 2 tumors recurred 7 and 15 months later and one patient lost to image follow-up and expired within 6 months after GK. Five out of seven patients of group B remained local control at the last image follow-up (6 to 62 months after GK). However, three patients of this group of had prominent brain damage shown by MRI and PET scan after salvage irradiation. The median survival of all our patients is 48.8 months. The five-year survival rate is 36.4%.\\nConclusion : Combined fractionated RT, GK radiosurgery and concurrent chemotherapy seem to achieve better local control for intracranially recurrent NPC than GK alone. It is not recommended to use single-fraction radiosurgery to salvage a newly diagnosed skull base recurrent NPC. Bilateral opposing fields in fractionated RT should be avoided to lower the incidence of late complications.'},\n",

It is a simple way to keep the radiation dose to the distal normal tissue below one half of the tumor dose.  The optimum wedge angle depends on the hinge angle between the wedged-pair fields.  The hinge angle can be easily determined in conventional 2D radiation planning, because the two wedged-pair fields are usually coplanar with treatment couch set at 0? 90?or 270?  In non-coplanar 3D radiation planning, hinge angle is difficult to be calculated.  In addition, the wedge orientations are most likely not opposed to one another.  An accurate mathematics formula to align two wedged-pair fields into coplanar orientation in 3D space is derived and implemented into a computer program.  The optimization program requires only two parameters, gantry angle and couch angle, for each of the wedged-pair fields.  It calculates the collimator angles of the wedged-pair fields and aligns the wedge direction and the isocenter on a single plane.  It also calculates the hinge angle of the wedged-pair fields and suggests a wedge angle for optimal dose distribution.

The latter method takes into account in convolution algorithm. \\nMaterials and Methods : Treatment was planned based on Alderson-Rando phantom held in an immobilization device. Doses were calculated on FOCUS release 2.0 planning system both for 2D-RT and 3D-CRT, and irradiation were performed on Varian C-Series 600C linear accelerator, 6MV x-ray. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were placed inside the target to compare the dose based on each method. The prescribed dose was180 cGy in isocenter.\\nResults : The delivered doses by using 3D-CRT planning and 2D with Power Law Method correction were closer to the prescribed dose (173 cGy, 172 cGy in a 5 x 5 cm2 field and 175 cGy, 174 cGy in a 10 x 10 cm2 field). The delivered dose by using 2D-RT planning without heterogeneity correction was significantly higher (212 cGy and 216 cGy). \\nConclusion : Dose variation between measurement and calculation is due to tissue inhomogenity, especially in the lung. Power Law Method accounts with tissue inhomogeneity but not with the 3D shape of inhomogeneity tissue. 3-D treatment planning with inhomogeneity correction based on CT image, delivers more accurate dose. Use of 3-D planning in lung cancer should reduce the risk of radiation side effects while optimizing delivery to the tumor.'},\n",

The distance from block surface to tray (BSTD) is 10, 15 and 25 cm for the blocks. High energy photon beams of 6 and 10 MV generated by SIEMENS KDS-2 Linac were used in this study. Asymmetric field with equivalent field size of 10 ?10 cm2 was used for all the measurements. Peripheral doses were measured by using a Farmer type chamber and Acrylic solid phantom. Ionization charges were collected by a Victoreen 500 electrometer. PD for different depth, BSTD, and block thickness were evaluated. Nucletron water phantom system with 0.12 c.c. R K chamber was used for measuring the variations of PD with distances from field edge and depth. PD with and without block were measured also. \\nResult and Discussion : We find that block with BSTD equal to 25 cm decrease the PD most. When distance from field edge is 5 cm and depth at 5 cm, the PD relative to Dmax (dose at dmax) at central axis is 1.74% without block, and is 0.86% with block for 6 MV. The block with thickness of 15 cm has the best attenuation effect, and reduce the PD to 0.45% relative to Dmax . The PD decreases as the distance from field edge increases. Close to the field edge, the PD drops initially with depth, the minimum apperance at the depth that deeper than the dmax (depth of maximum dose) of the central ray 0.5 cm. Behind the dmax, the PD increases gradually with depth and then become nearly constant farther. The qualitative behavior of the PD is similar for 6 and 10 MV.\\nConclussion : From the results, we know that the blocks have obvious contribution for reducing the PD, and that advantage is used conviently, made easily, low cost, but shortcoming is just suitable for small treatment field.

For the Degubond 4 denture sample at a depth of 5 cm with a setup of 6 MV, 10 × 10 cm2, SAD = 100 cm, the dose disturbance range in depth dose is around 2 cm. The back scattering electrons cause a 40% dose increment in front of the sample and the shielding effect decreases the dose of about 20% behind the sample. Maximum range disturbs the dose profile is about 1.2 cm. The energy range of the back scattering photons is between 0.2 and 0.6 MeV.\\nConclusion: The size of the denture sample used in the study is small, but the density is quite high, hence the perturbation effect is still significant.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: This study performed the simulation of the dose distribution around the embedded high-den-sity metal material.\\nMaterials and Mathods: The simulation is focused on the Varian 21EX LINAC machine and imple-mented by the OMEGA/BEAM code system. For modeling the linear accelerator, the simulation para-meters are adjusted by comparing the results of the depth doses and the setup of 6 MV, 40 × 40 cm2, SAD= 100 cm in a homogeneous water phantom. Then, the dose disturbance has been investigated for the setup of 6 MV, 10 × 10 cm2 SAD= 100 cm with a denture sample.\\nResults and Discussion : The adjusted LINAC parameters have been proved by the verifications of the depth doses and dose profiles calculated by DOSXYZ with the measurement setup of 6 MV, 40 × 40 cm2, SSD = 100 cm. It shows that the capability of simulating the Varian 21EX  LINAC has been established. For the Degubond 4 denture sample at a depth of 5 cm with a setup of 6 MV, 10 × 10 cm2, SAD = 100 cm, the dose disturbance range in depth dose is around 2 cm. The back scattering electrons cause a 40% dose increment in front of the sample and the shielding effect decreases the dose of about 20% behind the sample. Maximum range disturbs the dose profile is about 1.2 cm. The energy range of the back scattering photons is between 0.2 and 0.6 MeV.\\nConclusion : The size of the denture sample used in the study is small, but the density is quite high, hence the perturbation effect is still significant. Besides, the spatial range of the perturbation is relative-ly small; it is difficult to be measured. In this study, it shows that the detailed information includes depth dose, dose profile at several depth, and the photon/electron spectrums could be obtained by Monte Carlo simulation, and could provide for the further study.'},\n",

One of the characteristics of TG-51 is being based on the use of the ion chambers calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to water in a 60Co beam. The calibration factors of are defined as N. The other is that the parameters needed for dose calculation are much more simplified than in TO-21 The conversion factor for beam quality of photon in TG-51 is kQ, for electron are P, k'R50'k, k.The purpose of this paper is to development complete TG-51 dose calculation program to decrease the errors arising from looking up tables and doing calculations. \\nMaterials and Methods: We use Visual Basic 6.0 produced by Microsoft to develop a does calculation program of TG-15. The flowchart of this program follows the procedure of worksheet in TG-51. We verified the accuracy of this program by putting in the data in TO-51 Workshop provided by AAPM Radiological Physics Center. Results: Compared with the data provided by AAPM, the differences of photon and electron dos calculations are within 0.0269% and 0.0429%, respectively. \\nConclusion: This program is a convenient, accurate and simple tool for dose calculation. Medical physicists can implement it to decrease the errors arising from looking up tables, and apply it in the clinical reference dosimetry practically.”\"},\n",

A neural-network is employed to relate the actual dose and energy spectra. After calibration and training, the optical densities of the four films can be input to the network to yield the actual dose at any location. \\nResults: The PDD of a 20 x 20 field size and the dose distribution of an off-axis location at 5cm are estimated using this trained neural network. The maximum differences between the measurements of this film system and ionization chamber were less than ±4%, and less than 2% for the mean error in our investigation. \\nConclusion: Optical density and dose relationship can be found and converted by our neural-net system.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: New advances in radiotherapy technology enable us to attain higher dose delivery to tumor region, resulting in greater tumor control probability, with this sophistication there is more demand to control the uncertainties contributed by organ motion. The organ motion related uncertainties can be mainly classified into three main categories: (I) the blurring of planning images due to internal organ motion during CT scan acquisition; (II) intrafractional organ motion that affect the dose distribution within a single treatment delivery; (III) interfractional organ motion that affect the dose distribution between treatments. For patients with supradiagphragmatic and infradiagphragmatic tumor, respiration is a major factor that causes the displacement of the internal organ. For further under standing the magnitude of the respiratory organ motion, we endeavor to investigate: (I) the geometrical differences in spatial displacement of the tumor and critical organ while in free breathing status and breath holding status; (II) measures the magnitude of the respiratory organ motion in the cranio-caudal direction; (III) makes a preliminary feasibility study of the coaching breathing technique to improve the reproducibility of the respiratory cycle and hence reduce the variation of organ motion in between treatment. Results and Methods: The data were collected between March 2001 to October 2001in our department from subjects undergoing radiation therapy of the thoracic and abdominal regions using our spiral CT and real time Respiratory Gating system to measure and analyze the variation of respiratory organ motion. A voice coaching technique is designed to improve the consistency of the respiration cycles. Results and Conclusions: Our analysis shows a significant variation of tumor and organ geometry between free breathing and breath holding state. The cranio-caudal displacement are 15.5±3.5 mm for diaphragm and 13.7±2.4 mm for pancreas, respectively. For patients in our study, coaching technique may improve the reproducibility for those patient whose breathing cycles is not consistent within intrafraction treatment, but not for those with consistent cycles.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To evaluate the effect of post-operative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and to determine the prognostic factors in esophageal cancer. \\nMaterials and Methods: From October 1991 to November 2000, fifty-six patients with esophageal cancer received post-operative radiotherapy at VGH-KS. Twenty-three patients were treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone at 50 Gy and others underwent RT combined with chemotherapy (C/T) consisting of cisplatin plus 5-flurouracil (5-FU). There was no significant difference in patient characteristics between two groups, except in tumor length. We compared overall, disease-free, loco-regional-free and distant-metastasis-free survival rates between two groups. We also analyzed various prognostic factors including age, tumor length, tumor stage, status of surgical margin, lymph node (LN) metastasis, vascular or neural invasion, and the time interval between operation and radiotherapy.\\nResults: The median follow-up time was 16 months. For all patients, the overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 20.2%, and the disease-free survival (DFS) was 19.1 %. Loco regional failure occurred in 14.3% of patients and 35.7% of patients developed distant metastasis. The 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 42.7% and 23.7% for RT group and 41.0% and 16.0% for CCRT group. There was no significant difference in as and DFS between two groups (p= 0.694 and 0.875). In lymph node metastatic patients, overall and disease-free survivals of CCRT group were not superior to those of RT group (p= 0.273 and 0.486). In CCRT group, there was also no significant difference in as and DFS between the patients receiving less than 3 cycles of C/T and those receiving more (p= 0.968 and 0.406, respectively). By the uni-variate analysis, we found that neural invasion, numbers of LN metastases and involved LN levels, and the percentage of positive dissected LN affected the survival rates. The only prognostic factor of survivals in the multi-variate analysis was the involvement of more than one LN level. \\nConclusion: Based on our analysis, post-operative combination therapy is no better than adjuvant radiotherapy alone in disease control. The most important prognostic factors affecting the post-operative survival rate of patients are the number of positive lymph node and LN levels involved, the percentage of positive dissected LN and neural invasion.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: An important issue for cancer patients, who are destined to receive craniospinal irradiation (CSI), is how to reduce the overall time needed for simulation. Furthermore, it is necessary that more accurate tools are designed and adapted so that there is increased accuracy in the determination of the optimal irradiation position and field. This will increase the level of confidence of radiation oncologists with respect to these factors. In this study, we investigated and evaluated simulation techniques that utilize computed tomography (CT) for simulation of craniospinal irradiation. Material and Methods: A PQ5000 computed tomography simulator (CT-sim) has been available since 2000 at the Department of Radiation Oncology of Linkou Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital. The VOXEL Q treatment planning system and the ACQ-sim virtual simulation software were employed to access images for processing to allow the reconstruction of three-dimensional images and the accurate identification of the location and size of the tumor. Subsequently, the treatment-related parameters such as field size, the angles of gantry and collimator, and the customized block could be decided. Result: Conventional CSI simulation, which is similar to traditional X-ray simulation, is rather time consuming, requiring thirty to fifty minutes to accomplish all the processes. In addition, the patient must assume an uncomfortable prone position during which the chin and nose inevitably has to bear the weight of the head. In CT-sim, the patient adopts a supine position for CSI. With this simulation technique and position, not only does the patient feels much more comfortable as well as the simulation time needed being reduced to ten to fifteen minutes, but it also seems to be a more accurate method for determining the treatment parameters. Discussion: The benefits of CT-sim, when utilized for CSI, include a reduction in the simulation time to only one third of that needed for conventional X-ray simulation, an increased level of confidence for the radiation oncologist with respect to the determination of the radiation beam and field size and, most important of all, a decrease in treatment errors caused by patient motion during the simulation.'},\n",

Materials and Methods: From December 1993 through July 2001, 82 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma underwent radiotherapy as adjuvant or definitive treatment. Ten patients were carriers of type B chronic hepatitis on serology test. Six of 10 patients who developed grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicity within 4 months after radiotherapy, formed the basis of this study. Five patients underwent external-beam radiotherapy with 45 Gy/1.8 Gy/25 fractions and 18 MV photons delivered to the tumor bed and regional lymphatics Over 5 weeks. One patient had the radiotherapy with 50.4 Gy/28 fractions. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of 3-6 (median: 5) weekly cycles of intravenous infusion with 5fluorouracil 2 gm/m2 and leucovorin 300mg/m2 for 24 hours. Dose-volume histograms of the critical organs were used for the dosimetric factors in these patients.  Results: Six patients developed grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicity, with a median interval of 38 days from completion of radiotherapy. One patient died of this complication and five patients recovered. All but one patient had either serologic or histological evidence of reactivation of chronic viral hepatitis. Mean dose of liver of the 6 patients ranged from 10.4 Gy to 22.9 Gy (mean: 17.2 Gy), while the percent volume receiving more than 30 Gy of radiation (V3o Gy) ranged from 7% to 37% (mean: 24%). Mean normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was 3.3%, ranging from 0.03% to 6.8%. Mean hepatic dose, V30GY, and NTCP were all significantly lower than those of the 12 patients with hepatocelular carcinoma and radiation-induced liver disease after three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Conclusion: Hepatic toxicity after concurrent chemoirradiation, in patients who were carriers of type B chronic hepatitis and underwent treatment for gastric cancer, deserves special attention and was rarely reported in the literature. The tolerance of liver to radiation was even lower than expected in the presence of concurrent chemotherapy.'},\n",

Materials and Methods: From September 1992 to December 1997, 181 cases (32 IB, 23 IIA, 102 IIB, 3IIIA, 2IIIB) who survived more than 12 months after treatment and the long-term survivors should receive a minimum 3 years of follow-up, were entered in our study. Initially, they were treated with 10 MV X-rays for 44 - 45 Gy / 22 - 25 fractions over 4-5 weeks to whole pelvis Radiation dose for patients with FIGO Stage IIB-III bilateral parametrial disease was boosted to 54-58 Gy, with a central shielding. After the completion of whole-pelvis radiotherapy, HDRICB was performed using an Ir-192 remote after loading technique at one-week intervals. Fifty-one patients received three insertions, while 130 patients had four insertions. The prescribed dose for each HDRICB was 7.2 Gy to Point A for three insertions (before July 1995), or 6.0 Gy for four insertions (after July 1995). HDRICB dosimetry was calculated using orthogonal films exposed during each insertion. Doses to both ICRU and conventional rectal reference points were calculated for each patient. The overall duration of treatment ranged from 47-90 days (median, 60). Patient and treatment related factors were evaluated for late rectal complication using logistic regression model. Results: Median follow-up of these patients was 58 months (range: 38-110 months). Forty-five patients (24.9%) had late rectal complications (27 Grade 1, 13 Grade 2, 5 Grade 3-4). The probability of rectal complications shows a better correlation of doseresponse with increasing total brachytherapy ICRU rectal dose. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated a high risk of late rectal sequelae in patients who had Stage IIB-III disease (p = 0.002, relative risk, 3.66, 95% CI 1.82-6.45) and total ICRU rectal dose greater than 20 Gy (p = 0.005, relative risk, 1.62, 95% CI1.03-3.21).

Materials and Methods: Between 1st, Dec. 1985 and 31, Dec. 1991, 126 patients with pathology proven stages I and II carcinoma of the uterine cervix were treated by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy (some of them underwent abdominal total hysterectomy) (ATH) followed with post operative irradiation at Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang-hua Christian Hospital. The indications for radiotherapy were based on pathologic findings including lymph node metastasis, positive Surgical margins, lymphovascular permeation, primary tumor size≧3.0 cm, parametrial involvement, corpus invasion, previous inadequate surgery (ATH) or more than one combination of the above. Patients usually received external beam irradiation 39.6 Gy to 61.2 Gy to the whole pelvis, and the vaginal cuff were boosted by intravaginal brachytherapy. All patients who received complete course of radiotherapy had follow-up period between 8 and 256 months (median: 113 months). The prognosis related histologic parameters including histologic subtypes, tumor grade, longitudinal tumor dimension, lymphovascular space invasion, corpus invasion, parametrial extension, vaginal invasion and pelvic lymph node(s) (PLN) metastases were collected and evaluated with univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: All the 126 cases were evaluated, analyzed and followed until closure of this study (Jun. 2001). Half(63) of all the cases died. The survival duration was calculated from time of histologic diagnosis to the time of last follow-up or death. The estimated 5- and 10-year survival rate of surgical stages IB, IIA and IIB were 65%, 75%, 62% and 59%, 49%, 53%respectively (p ＞ 0.05). Univariate analysis revealed that PLN metastases, histologic subtype, tumor size and corpus invasion were significant in survival (p ＜ 0.05). Among these variables, we found that histologic subtype and PLN metastases were identified as the most independent and significant prognostic factors (p ＜ 0.005) which have major analysis using Cox regression model. Conclusions: In the current study, which enrolled 126 cases of cervical cancer patients having hysterectomy and post-operative irradiation, we found that histologic subtype (non-See from pathologic classification) and PLN metastases (number of metastatic nodes more than 2) have the worst 5- and 10year survival rate, and were recognized as two independent and significant prognostic variables by Cox's model.\"},\n",

Although the conventional method of external irradiation to HCC has been proven not effective, three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) may be an alternative choice. In this study, the prognostic factors and results of 3D-CRT to PVT area as the initial treatment for HCC with PVT patients who could not receive other treatments was investigated. \\nMaterials and Methods : From September 1997 to August 1999, 42 patients who were initially diagnosed as HCC with PVT without any previous treatment and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status superior to Grade II were enrolled into the study. Radiation therapy (RT) was given via 3D-CRT technique to PVT area with 50 Gy to 61.3 Gy in daily fraction of 1.8 Gy to 2.5 Gy by individual condition. Age, sex, ECOG performance status, Child-Pugh classification, tumor location, tumor type, invaded PVT area, radiation treatment volume, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding history, viral hepatitis markers for B and C, and pre-treatment liver function, on-treatment liver function, post-treatment liver function, including Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Total Bilirubin (Bil-T), were recorded for analysis. \\nResults: Twenty-four patients (57%) completed the RT course and others withdrew from RT due to worsened ECOG performance status. Seven complete RT patients were lost to follow-up. Nine of 17 followed patients (53%) had positive response to RT. Seven patients (41%) underwent further TAE after RT. In the patients who could complete RT, overall survival for 3 months and 6 months were 63% and 34%. Survival rate for incomplete RT patients was 24% and 8% for 3 months and 6 months respectively. There was statistically significant difference (p = 0.022) in survival between patients who completed RT and their counterpart. There were no significant difference in pre-treatment, on-treatment and post-treatment AST, ALT and Bil-T level. Only 6 patients (35%) were reported to have suspicious gastric complications. Bil-T was the only significant factor for predicting whether RT could be completed or not (p = 0.028). \\nConclusions : Less than half of the patients completed the planned RT and were adequately followed, indicating the poor prognosis and selection of patients in this study. Further prospective control studies with appropriate patient enrollment, such as low bilirubin level, is required to verify the feasibility, patterns of failure, and the possible benefit of 3D-CRT as the initial treatment of HCC with PVT.'},\n",

       "  'e': \"Purpose: Chromosomal changes, chromosome aberrations and sister-chromatid exchanges are widely used as indicators of chromosomal DNA damage. The relationship between numbers of SCE and low dose irradiation in V-79 cells was investigated. \\nMaterials and Methods: The Chinese hamaster cells, V-79 cell line, were grown and irradiated by low doses of 137Cs γ-ray at an exposure dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min. The sister-chromatid exchanges were stained by Sorensen's buffer containing Hoechst and Giemsa. Newman-Keuls test was employed to analyze the difference of SCEs between one group and others.

While the ratios of SCE in higher treated dose for 0.25 and 0.5 Gy were 50% and 53%, respectively. With dose increasing, ratios of SCE became saturated. In addition, the data were analyzed by dividing into four sections (≦5, 6-8, 9-11, and≧12) based on SCE numbers in each cell. The results demonstrated that SCE numbers in all treated groups were mainly in 6~8 and 9~11 sections, and percentages were about 66~68 %.

In this study, SCE numbers increased quickly at first division from 0 to 0.01 Gy, and the increased frequency in second part was slow down. Low dose irradiation not only increase SCE numbers, but also change the distribution of SCE numbers.\"},\n",

The Rotterdam applicator can deliver prescribed dose to the lesion area without too much hot spot in the treatment of T1-T2a NPC. However, when Rotterdam applicator was placed to the nasopharynx for few days during the treatment, patients would feel much discomfort. It therefore needed intravenous medication or fluid to relieve patients' discomfort. Besides, Rotterdam applicator also has the limitation in coverage of tumor with huge parapharyngeal space extension or to intracranial area. For the treatment of advanced NPC, it may still be at the price of very high radiation hot spot and face the risk of severe necrosis or bone perforation.\\nConclusion : With the treatment of small nasopharyngeal tumor, we will suggest Rotterdam applicator to be the choice as an aid of brachytherapy boost. However, there will be a great potential to improve the shape of the Rotterdam applicator to fit better in our patients in order to be common use for the improvement of the radiation dose distribution to the nasopharyngeal area.\"},\n",

The small size (1mm x 1mm x 1mm cube) TLD-100H LiF dosimeter is chosen to minimize the influence of dose gradient in measurement. The compositions of bone and lung phantoms are referred to ICRU report 44. \\nResults: The radial dose function and anisotropy function in water agree with published data in less than 1%. The radial dose function in bone decreases with depth much more than those in water and the difference can be up to 21%. In contrast, the dose distribution in lung shows less attenuation and scatter than in water and the difference can be up to 16%. The TLD measurements and Monte Carlo results agree within statistical uncertainty (approximately +/- 5%) when the radial distance is larger than 1 cm. At 0.5-cm radial distance, the extreme high dose gradient causes the measurement uncertainty to become too large to estimate the consistency. \\nConclusions: Most of previous studies focused on the dosimetry around an Iridium-192 in water. Through this study, we obtain a better understanding of the dose distributions in heterogeneities, bone and lung tissue.'},\n",

All cases were classified histologically according to the WHO criteria for nasopharyngeal tumor, and were then re-staged according to the 4th American joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC, 1992) staging system. Radiotherapy (RT) consisted of 70.2 Gy to the primary tumor with optional boost dose depending on tumor response. Regional lymphatics were irradiated with a dose ranging from 50.4Gy to 70.2 Gy, based on the size of the involved lymph nodes. A cobalt-60 or 6 MV X-ray linear accelerator (Seimens Mevatron) was used for radiotherapy. All patients were then followed-up regularly until death. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine actuarial survival. Logrank test and Cox regression analysis were used for comparison and determination of prognostic factors.\\nResults: Among the 283 patients, a total of 50 patients were excluded from our study due to incomplete treatment. The mean dose received by these patients were 27.09 Gy (range: 3 Gy – 47.5 Gy). Their overall 5-year actuarial survival was only 16.1 %, with a median survival of 14 months. Thirty-seven of 50 patients died. The mortality rate was 74% (37/50), with most of them dying from systemic disease. The remaining 233 patients were analyzed. The male to female ratio was 2.4:1. Three were 28 patients with local recurrence, reflecting a local control rate of 87.9%. Cox regression analysis revealed that N stage was the only significant factor for local control. Sixty (26%) patients developed distant metastasis, mainly to the bone, the lung, and the liver.

The histological diagnoses for these patients were adenoid cystic carcinoma (n= 4), poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (n= 3), and mucoepider-moid carcinoma (n= 2). This group consisted of two females and seven males, with a median age of 41 years (range, 15 to 72). Two patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma and one with the adenoid cystic variant underwent transpalate excision of the tumor before irradiation.

Dose distribution simulation is carried out for 6 MV and 15 MV, 10 × 10、20 × 20 and 30 ×30 cm2 fields in a water phantom. The phantom size in 30 cm in radius and 10 cm in thickness. The areas selected for dose calculation of 10 × 10、20 × 20 and 30 ×30 cm2 fields are 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 cm in radius, respectively. Total twenty voxels of thickness 0.05mm (50μm) from water surface and 1 voxel of thickness 0.1cm at Dmax were selected for dose calculation. The dose ratios of voxels at surface region to voxel at Dmax form the PDD curve at surface region.\\nResult and Discussion: The relative error of all voxels is within 1% with the exception of some voxels within 2% in 30 × 30 cm2 field. The PDD curves at surface region were fit with 4th order polynomial function. The x2 value of each fitting is better than 0.997. The PDD value at water surface ( X=0) for 6 MV, 10 × 10、20 × 20 and 30 × 30 cm2 fields are 13.67 ± 0.17%、23.07 ± 0.35% and 29.75 ± 0.52%, respectively.

Conservative surgical treatments were performed by wide excision and marginal excision, respectively. The interstitial catheters were implanted with 1-cm spacing in a parallel array intra-operatively. High dose rate brachytherapy was planned by Plato Brachytherapy Planning System and was started 4 days after the operation by the application of the micro selection after loader using iridum-192 as the irradiation source. The total doses were 2880cGy and 2800 cGy respectively and were applied in 8 and 7 fractions was given to one case but was withheld in the second case due to delayed wound healing after brachytherapy. There were on significant wound complications in the first case. There was also no bone fracture or peripheral nerve damage in either case except muscle fibrosis occurred after the irradiation. Both of the patients were satisfied with the function of the preserved limbs during a follow up one year later. No local recurrence or distant metastasis was seen at present. For advanced lower limbs soft tissue sarcoma, wide excision plus interstitial brachytherapy may be an alternative management for the preservation of the limbs. Though we had a good initial local control of these two cases but it does not indicate there will be a good prognosis later on. However it did improve the patient’s quality of life and their self-con-fidence in facing the disease.

The CMS.FOCUS planning system was used to generate these 3-D radiotherapy plans. The plans were evaluated with respect to daily treatment time and ease of treatment delivery, achievement of dose requirement to tumor with normal tissue sparing, dose-volume histograms of gross target volume and critical normal structures, potential radiobiological effects and toxicity of concurrent chemotherapy. The treatment responses were defined by the serial follow-up MRI and Tc-99mnuclear scans.\\nResults: Each time only 2-4 portals were needed to deliver a tumoricidal dose (200 cGyonce a day to 7000 cGy, or 120 cGy twice a day to 7440 cGy) to 100% of the primary tumor target volume while still keeping the doses of the adjacent critical normal structures within safety limits. The DVH of GTV is similar to that of IMRT but the DVHs of spinal cord and mandible are similar to those of 3DCRT. The highest dose was centered to the heavy tumor burden area. There was no any hot spot in normal tissue. This treatment was well tolerated and showed only moderate toxicity, even with concurrent chemotherapy.

Currently, in VGHTPE Hospital, daily manually calibration and documentation on each radiotherapy machine have been used on quality assurance, which is time consuming while performing data integration and transfermation inter machines. Therefore, we set up an intranet system to perform automatic calibration and integrate database to shorten the processing time of quality assurance meanwhile acquire up dated and complete report after all the procedures have been done.\\nMaterials and Methods: 1. Design WebPages in data transfermation and integration, use Microsoft visual basic 6.0 and Borland C++ builder 4.0 to design intranet webpages for treatment machines. There are two modules (therapeutic technique and mechanical quality assurance) installed on each treatment station, and the tolerance tables are well defined. 2. In running the daily calibration, design a virtual water solid phantom (water-equivalent) to acquire the energy distribution and decide the depth of the ion chamber. According to the size of the build up cap of the tested ion chamber to decide the size of the cylinder. The size of build up phantom is 30 cm by 30 cm and the depths are varied. By using these devises, we can run the tests on the daily radiation output stability, x-ray stability, beam flatness and asymmetry, optical range-finder, portal accuracy and laser beam alignment and all the data are recorded. \\nResult: Obtaining and transferring all of the data mentioned above from various treatment machines to the main sever, we could integrate data and formulate reports at daily, weekly, monthly and annually bases and further plot histograms according to different requirements. By performing these procedures, we could assure the quality of the treatment machines and build detailed database for property analysis. \\nConclusion: While we emphasize the quality assurance of radiotherapy, the quality assurance of treatment machines becomes the most important issue. Therefore, via practically use computer network system in quality assurance of radiotherapy machines is the most effective way to reach the goal of better quality assurance.'},\n",

Two different bolus were used: bolus 1 emphasized only AP depth, bolus 2 emphasized both AP and bilateral depth. So there were six various combinations by either monoisocentric or moving junction with or without bolus. First, isodose distribution by computer planning system was generated to decide where to place TLDs. The average radiation dose in different techniques were obtained by irradiating the phantom packed with TLDs.\\nResults: Both monoisocentric techniques and moving junction techniques with adequate bolus could generate homogenous dose distributions. But if there were no bolus, there was hot area over neck. However there were still uneven dose distribution areas, such as hot areas in anterior superficial neck and lateral neck; cold areas in posterior lower neck. In comparison, monoisocentric technique with bolus 2 tended to create better dose distribution. After comparing data from TLDs and computer planning system, we found most differences were within 4%. However, inconsistency still existed in some locations such as field margins (underestimate 19-22%); junction areas (over/underestimate 9%); superficial areas (underestimate 5-7%).\\nConclusion: Both monoisocentric techniques and moving junction techniques combined with well-designed bolus can be satisfactorily applied in treating head and neck cancer patients with huge neck lymphadenopathy. There are not only good reproducibili﹒ ty but also good homogeneity. How to choose the optimal technique depends on patients' clinical status and individual hospital equipments.

The drawback of this numerical algorithm was its long calculation time. In our study, an equal probability sampling method was adopted in hope that less sampling points were necessary while the same calculation accuracy can still be maintained. Calculation results for electron energy loss process in homogeneous media were reported.\\nMaterial and Methods: The multiple scattering theory of Moliere was used in the modified numerical algorithm to simulate electron angular scattering; while Landau's ionizational energy loss theory was used to simulate electron energy loss process. At present, energy loss due to bremsstrahlung production was not included in the algorithm. Test calculation of collisional stopping power for 20, 10 and 6 MeV electrons incident into water under simplified condition (excluding electron multiple scattering) was performed. The energy loss process for the same setup was also simulated. In order to verify the calculation accuracy of the numerical code, EGS4 Monte Carlo code was adopted to perform benchmark calculation.\\nResults: When excluding electron multiple scattering, the calculation of collisional stopping power shows discrepancy of less than 2% between numerical calculation and ICRU reports for high energy electrons (20 and 10 MeV). For low electrons (6 MeV), this discrepancy is close to 3%. The calculation esults of absolute depth-dose distribution demonstrate that the calculated depths of 50% dose agree with EGS4 to within 3 mm and the calculated electron ranges to within 2 mm.\\nConclusion: Landau's theory is suitable for simulating electron ionizational energy loss in homogeneous media and the error due to equal probability sampling of electron energy loss distribution is acceptable.\"},\n",

So autograft provides the best result in bone reconstruction. However, it is impossible to find exactly the same length of autograft as what we had resected in the operation from our body. By the use of intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation to the tumor bearing bone segment, the soft tissue is preserved and the dead bone can be used to re-implant and substitute the bone defect. There is no limitation in dose escalation for irradiation of bone extracorporeally. The sarcomatous change of the adjacent normal soft tissue induced by radiation need not to be considered. In this paper, we tried to use this new method to provide a tumor free autograft for limb salvage surgery in two cases of locally advanced osteogenic sarcoma in lower limbs. A tumor dose of 30000 cGy was applied to the tumor bearing bone segment resected from both cases. The heavily irradiated specimen was sent back to the operation room immediately for re﹒implantation. The initial functional result was encouraging after six months of immobilization. Intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation with no dose limitation plays an important role in providing a sterile tumor free autograft with good bone union of the diseased leg. Unfortunately both cases had local tumor recurrence within one year after operation, inadequate neoadjuvant chemotherapy and inadequate (marginal) resection for locally advanced disease may be the main reasons for these early recurrences. We think that limb salvage surgery is a potential method only for some highly selected patients with good neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic response. Moreover, the tumor bearing bone segment should be resected with wide surgical margin to achieve a better long-term local tumor control.'},\n",

Our experience with dosimetric measurements for this modality is reported.\\nMaterials and Methods: The source-to-surface distance (SSD) was extended to be 323 cm, and an 0.8 cm-thick acrylic screen was installed at 15 cm in front of the treatment plane to scatter the beam and attenuate the electron energy. At first, the optimal dual-field angle was determined in order to achieve feasible dose uniformity in the vertical dimension, and then field flatness could be assured. Film dosimetry was applied to define depth dose distribution profile of electron beam at treatment plane. Accordingly, the output of the linear accelerator could be calibrated. Multiplication factor was deter-mined to be 2.68, represented as the ratio of the absorbed dose from all six dual-fields to that from one dual-field measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) taped at Rando phantom. Thus, the value of MU for each field could be calculated. TLDs were used for in vivo dosimetry to verify the skin dose and evaluate dose variation at different anatomic sites.\\nResults: The determined dual-field angle (20 ) and multiplication factor (2.68) were comparable to those described in the literature. Depth dose distribution and beam penetration were satisfying, and X-ray background level (0.75%) was also acceptable. Markedly decreased output of the Linac (0.0684 cGy/MU) could be partially compensated with the escalation of dose rate (600 MU/min). Thus, each treatment would not cost too much time. Does variation among different sites at skin is compatible with the experience of other institutions. Instead, field flatness in the horizontal dimension (±1O% within 60 cm) did not meet the requirement given by AAPM.\\nConclusion: The technique of TSET is complex. Dosimetry for this modality should be studied case by case systematically and thoroughly.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: This article introduces and compares the latest TO-51 clinical dosimetry protocol to the earlier protocol, TG-21. Based on the methodology of TG-21 and TG-51, the differences in clinical dosimetry measurements for both protocols are described and performed. Finally, precautions in performing the latest protocol were listed to avoid errors in clinic.\\nMaterials and Methods: The electrometer (Keithley 35617EBS) with 0.6 c.c. Farmer type cylindricalion chamber (NE2571) and 0.04 C.c. plane parallel ion chamber were employed for the measurements. The electrometer and ion chambers were authenticated by the Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Laboratory (ADCL) in University of Texas. Varian linear accelerators Clinic6/100s/n: 358 (Photon beam energy with 6 MV) and Clinic1800 s/n:180 (Photon beam energies with 6 and 18 MV, electron beam with energies 6, 9, 12, 16 and 20 MeV) were used for output measurements. The measurement protocols were based on TG-21 and TG-51 respectively, with output doses obtained to observe the variations in the monitor unit of the absorbed dose (cGy/MU).\\nResults: The variations of monitor unit in 6 MV photon were within 0.7% and 1.4%, 18 MV photon was 2.2%, and the average for photon energies was 1.43%. The higher the photon energy, the larger the variation, suggesting that higher photon energies produce more scatter radiation due to wider distributed energy spectrum. For the electron beam, the variations in monitor units were within 1.5 - 2.2% with the average of 1.84%, showing no dependency with the electron beam energies. The variations in electron beam output were slightly higher than the photon beam, possible reasons are the measurement points in TO-51 protocol for electron beam is different from earlier protocl, a more precise method to prescribe the relationship between the clinical beam quality and stopping power ratio of the electron beam and the plane parallel ion chamber is considered for the electron beam measurements.\\nConclusion: The TG-51 protocol is simple campared to TG-21 protocol as large tables of stopping power ratios and mass-energy absorption coefficients are omitted and the user does not need to calculate any theoretical dosimetry factors, hence reduces calculation errors. For convenience, worksheets encompass the measurement steps and required equipment is provided. In Taiwan, it is strongly recommended that national primary standards laboratory should be established to provide the absorbed-dose-to-water calibration factor (N)for ion chambers to avoid clinical errors and to meet the accuracy in advanced radiation therapy and dosimetry.'},\n",

The absorbed-dose to water calibration factor, N, is an important parameter, too. AAPM TO-21 protocol is based on an exposed (air-kerma) standard and multiple energy-dependent correction factors. The TG-51 protocol is based on an absorbed dose to water calibration factor (ND.IV) and an energy-dependent correction factor, kQ.

Every patient had three follow-up visits which included at the beginning of treatment, three days, and one month after completion of the treatment. The efficacy of theses two radiotherapy schedules was evaluated by each visit using a self-scoring questionnaire.\\nResults: There were no significant differences between the two treatment regimens in the degree of pain relief, the duration of pain relief, and the limitation of movement due to metastatic bone pain nor nausea or vomiting.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: Using CT-based simulation as an aid for breast cancer radiotherapy to increase the accuracy of treatment and hope to decrease the rate of lung fibrosis.\\nMaterials and Methods: From July 1994 to January 1999, we retrospectively analyzed 95 patients who received full course radiotherapy with regular follow-up at our department. The average age of the patients was 49 years old, and the median follow-up interval was 26.7 months. A method was devised to simulate patients with breast cancer in the actual treatment position by using a diagnostic CT spiral scanner and a workstation for virtual simulation. It was desired to produce non-divergent tangential beams through the lung at the matching line for tangential and supraclavicular fields. Bach patient was immobilized in an Alpha Cradle cast. Radio-opaque markers were placed on the margins of the fields decided by simulation and CT scan was performed. The data set was transferred to the workstation. After reconstruction of all the images, we performed virtual simulation from computer. When treatment parameters were decided, we would resimulate patient before treatment started. Patients received regular follow-up after completion of radiotherapy. Chest X-ray films were taken to detect lung metastasis and fibrosis while physical examination and chest CT were performed to evaluate local recurrence.\\nResults: All the chest X-ray films were rechecked and 5 patients (5.26%) with lung fibrosis were noted. According to the chart records and CT images, local recurrence was noted in 3 patients (3.16%). Among the 5 patients with lung fibrosis, the average greatest perpendicular distance (GPD) measured from the CT image was 1.75cm, the average irradiated lung volume of the tangential fields was 122.25 mlthat occupied 7% of the ipsilateral lung volume. For the 3 patients with local recurrence, the average GPD was 1.5cm, the average irradiated lung volume within the tangential fields was 155.48 ml, and the average irradiated lung volume was 6.12% of the ipsilateral lung.\\nConclusion: Using CT-based simulation as an aid for breast cancer radiation treatment was more accurate than traditional treatment planning. It provided us the accurate relationship between the position of the target and critical organs. We decrease irradiated lung volume and hope to reduce the chance of lung fibrosis.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: This study evaluates the usefulness of serial CEA, TPA, CA153 and combined modalities in serum levels for screening recurrence in patients with primary breast cancer after surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: CEA, TPA, and CA153 serial serum determinations were performed on 332 patients (median follow-up: 48.9 months) with primary breast cancer. Within the group, there were 195 clinically diagnosed episodes of relapse during follow- up. Comparison among groups by cut-off value, and dynamic changes of 20% and 30% were done.\\nResults: The sensitivity and specificity, determined for circulating tumor markers by cutoff levels were (for CEA)27.91%, 94.38%; (TPA) 63.37%, 53.13%; and (CM 53) 31.40%, 92.50%, respectively. Utilizing 20% dynamic change methods, CEA, TPA and CA1S3 showed sensitivities of 59.30%, 55.23% and 17.44%, and specificities of 18.75%, 38.13% and 99.38%, respectively.\\nConclusions: In this study, metastatic patients were classified into three categories of sites: viscera, bones and locoregional. Tumor marker sensitivity was clearly related to the site of recurrence; the lowest sensitivity was found in locoregional relapse and the highest was in patients with visceral metastasis, CA153 was more sensitive than CEA in monitoring breast cancer recurrence under cut-off methods but the results were reversed when serum concentration was evaluated by dynamic changes. For single markers, TPA presented the best sensitivity in all fields under cut-off methods, but was surpassed by CEA under dynamic changes for the detection of visceral metastasis. Unlike the other categories, when serum TPA values were determined by dynamic changes, the highest sensitivity was obtained for visceral metastasis detection. Significant elevation predicted new recurrence or tumor regrowth after complete remission. The combined use of CEA, TPA, and CA153 increased the overall sensitivity.'},\n",

There were Smen and 8 women, aged from 14 to 63 years old, with a mean age of 42.9 years old. Most of the patients presented with soft tissue signs, eye muscle impairment and proptosis. Patients received 20Gy in 2Gy per fraction to volume that included the entire area of abnormality and usually extended from the posterior globe to the anterior clinoids process.\\nResults: Sixty-three percent (10/16) of the patients responded successfully to radiotherapy. There was 62.5% (10/16) of the patients presenting with these signs demonstrated significant improvement. Patients with proptosis improved after treatment was 83.3% (5/6), respectively. Only 40.0% (4/10) of the patients showed improvement in the restriction of eye movement. Improvement of visual acuity was found in 60.0% (3/5) of the patients.\\nConclusion: Radiotherapy with a dosage of 20Gy is effective in preventing exacerbation of active inflammatory ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves' disease and eliminates the side effects associated with protracted use of corticosteroid. It is recommended that radiotherapy can be considered to treat patients who fail after steroid administration or have a contraindication to steroid. Surgical management such as orbit decompression may reserved for patients who have progressing or disabling proptosis after radiation therapy.\"},\n",

Consequently, this should lead to a more positive approach to convincing patients to submit to scientific medical treatment and increase their familiarity therewith, so that they can take advantage of both types of treatment when carried out simultaneously.\\nMaterials and Methods The study was carried out at the Linkou Chang Sung Memorial Hospital from November 1, 1997 to November 30, 1999. Eight hundreds and seventy-two patients were entered in the study, being cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy at the hospital's Radiation Oncology Department. Admission was based on a questionnaire that had to be filled in by each patient, in which they were assisted by senior nursing staff of the Radiation Oncology Department. This questionnaire had to be filled in twice, the first time within the first week during radiotherapy and the second time within 6 months after completion of the treatment.\\nResults There were various types of alternative treatments that the studied patients received before or during the radiotherapy course, including folk recipe, breathing exercises, massage, vegetarian food. Among the various types of alternative treatments, diet alternative treatments were most significantly increased during radiotherapy. Therefore, it was understood that the cancer patients thought diet was closely associated with cancer diseases. Of those patients who turned to alternative treatment methods either before or during radiotherapy, most would choose more than one alternative, but mostly in the form of popular treatment methods primarily being the administering of medicinal herbs. One hundred sixty and one patients would recommend such treatments to other patients. Whether or not alternative treatment methods were effective directly influenced the patient's inclination to recommend such treatments to other patients (p＜0.0001). After local radiotherapy, the majority of the studied patients would design health care programs themselves and modify their life styles.\\nConclusion: The intent of the cancer patients to accept the standard treatments such as radiotherapy did not conflict with the intent for them to turn to alternative treatments. Although taking alternative treatments is not recommended, it is not practical to prohibit their use. Considering the vast cost turning to alternative treatments must result in, the medical and nursing staff should help the patients select their alternative treatments seriously in order to lead to economic difficulties and psychophysical affliction. Further large-scale clinical investigations are needed to study whether alternative treatments would influence the effectiveness of the recommended standard treatments or not.\",\n",

However, the development of an optimal assay system has to rely on the best combination of the accuracy of radiation dose delivery, optimal sampling time, skin fixation, staining and epidermal sheet separation etc. The present results proved it's superiority and applicability in terms of the assay technique. We believe that this technique will draw much attention to the people who study early and late radiation injury on the skin.\"},\n",

       "  'e': 'Mycosis fungoides is a rare T-cell lymphoma, but it accounts for about half of all cases of cutaneous 7-cell lymphoma. Radiation has long been used to treat patients with this radiosensitive disease. However, a significant proportion of patients present with generalized plaques or recurrence of lesions outside or even within the previously irradiated area, it challenged radiotherapists for decades how to irradiate skin (the superficial layer of a somewhat ”cylinder-like” human body) with not only larger field and higher dose but also tolerable toxicity. Radiation with low energy electrons generated by modern linear accelerators, depositing their energy within limited depth could spare deeper tissues. The six-dual-field technique, which provide more satisfying dose distribution for these requirements was developed at Stanford University three decades ago. Since then, the patients treated with total skin electron beam radiation would have better clinical response and minor toxicity.\\nWe adopted the six-dual-field technique to treat a 49-year-old male with generalized plaques. The source-to-surface distance was extended to be 323 cm, and an acrylic beam spoiler was installed to scatter the beam and attenuate the electron energy. The resulting electron energy was 2.62 MeV, generated by a 6 MeV Linac, the output of which was degraded to deliver 0.0648 cGy/MU (at the depth of maximum dose, d(subscript max). The collimator was fully opened to 40×40 cm^2 without a cone. The hinge angle of the dual-field was determined to be 20 degrees. The measured multiplication factor was 2.68. We prescribed a tumor dose at 5 mm depth beneath the skin surface (90% isodose profile). Overall, 1212 MU were required for each field. Beam flatness was within ±5% and ±10% in the vertical and horizontal dimensions, respectively. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used to evaluate dose homogeneity at 45 sites. Individualized boost or shielding was used at appropriate sites. Radiation therapy was administered for 4 consecutive days per week, with 2 days constituting a treatment cycle. On the first day of a cycle, half of the 6 dual-fields were irradiated, with the other half treated the other day A total dose of 36 Gy over 18 cycles was given with a fraction dose of 2 Gy. A 10-day midway break was given. The skin lesions responded well to this regimen, and itching was completely relieved prior to completion of the first half of the treatment course. Side effects (marked dermatitis of palms and soles and total hair loss) were acceptable. The patient refused subsequent adjuvant therapy.\\nDespite total skin radiation can achieve good initial clinical outcome, the management of patients with mycosis fungoides is still challenging. This disease has a predisposition to relapse, and the chance is dismal to cure patients with the disease beyond limited plaque stage for the time being. In additicn to radiation therapy, a variety of modalities have been in clinical use or in investigation. We suppose combination treatment should be administered in these patients to improve long-term control.'},\n",

This study is to evaluate the dose volume histogram (DVH) of the irradiated bowel volume by prone position with belly board in comparison to treatment in supine position technique. Two patients with rectal cancer were analyzed.\\nMaterials and Methods: Two groups of sequential computerized tomography (CT) scans were performed with 8-mm slice thickness for each patient. One group of the scans was obtained for patient with a belly board in a prone position, and the other one was in a supine position for comparing the bowel irradiation volume with the previous scan. Hard copies of CT scan slices for both patients were produced. The contours of small bowel volumes were outlined on each CT slice hard copy and the information was then digitized and entered into treatment planning computer. The cumulative and the differential DVHs were performed for evaluating the bowel irradiation volume.\\nResults: The cumulative DVH, which is used in assessing potential damage to normal tissue, shows that from 70% to 95% of the percentage dose in prone position has a 15% to 18% volume reduction compared to supine position. The differential DVH, which is useful in assessing uniformity of dose to tumors. shows that the irradiated bowel volume has been moved to a region of rower percentage dose.\\nConclusion: Displacement of bowel loops out of the true pelvis is done by using a belly board in the prone position for thin and obese patients instead of supine position to decrease the volume of the intestine under irradiation because of external compression. The pelvic board and a half-body cast can be applied to immobilize patient for precise positioning and repositioning throughout the entire treatment.'},\n",

She had two episodes of acute respiratory arrest and hypotension while in the hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed a heterogenous mass at lower brain stem region. Microscopic surgery only could yielded a piece of tumor that disclosed the entity of immature teratoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy with the regimen of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin was administered, but was interrupted due to sudden onset of respiratory arrest. In order to maintain brainstem function, limited-field irradiation with 39.6 Gy to planning target volume followed by a boost dose to the primary site by stereotactic radiotherapy were performed with a total dose of 54.6 Gy. Two weeks after radiotherapy, the patient began receiving monthly adjuvant chemotherapy for 4 cycles up to the time of this report.\\nResults: Previously elevated serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of both alpha-fetoprotein and beta human-chorionic gonadotropin returned to a normal range after irradiation.

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To evaluate the magnitude and corresponding factors of dose perturbation due to air to tissue inhomogeneity for megavoltage photon beams. The dosimetric property of resin, a major component of obturator or prosthesis, is investigated.\\nMaterials and Methods: The heterogeneity dose correction factor (HDCF) is introduced and defined as Di/Dh where Di is the dose at heterogeneous condition and Dh is dose of the same point in a homogenous phantom. Dose perturbation for varying sizes of cubic air-filled and resin-filled cavity were examined for 6 and 10 MV photon beams along the beam direction for both proximal side (entering the cavity) and distal side (leaving the cavity).\\nResults: Significant underdosage (more than 30%) can occur on the distal interface when the field size is equal to or less than the air cavity size, especially for higher energy photon beams. The HDCF increases with the increase in field sizes and can be greater than 1 unity, which indicates the possibility of overdosage, but it will remain constant afterwards. A buildup region is observed at the downstream measurements. Underdose phenomenon at the proximal air-phantom interface remains over a wide range of field sizes, but it is less significant (＜10%). The use of resin as the cavity tilling material will dramatically reduce the dose perturbation to within 2.5% on both interfaces, compared with a homogeneous condition.\\nConclusion: With an air cavity embedded in the treatment volume and under the condition of electron equilibrium of pre-cavity medium, the dose measured at interface and subsequent tissue is influenced by the relationship between the field size and cavity size, and also between the cavity shape and photon beam energy. Loss of scattered electron and increase of unattenuated photon beam balance it. Well designed planning with sufficient field size from proper energy beam is recommended. Resin can be used to fill the cavity for improving the dose distribution.'},\n",

Only 73 patients who had disease confined to the pelvis (stage A-D1) and completed the RT treatment were entered into this analysis. The median age was 67 years (range 53-78) and the median follow-up time was 38.5 months (range 7.8 -124.3). For convenience for comparison, we divided those patients into two groups for final analysis: group I - curative RT alone, 64 patients; group II - radical prostatectomy followed by adjuvant RT, 9 patients. Radiotherapy was delivered by conventional two-dimensional treatment plan. External irradiation was usually given by 10 or 15 MV X-ray to the pelvis and then coned down to the prostate and seminal vesicle, yielding a total dose of 4400 to 8400 cGy (mean 6638 cGy) for group I patients and 5600 to 6800 cGy (mean 5956 cGy) for group II patients. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant hormone therapy was given in 33 patients.\\nResults: Grade II acute gastrointestinal (01) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity were observed in 28 (38%) and 18 (25%) patients, respectively. There were one patient with acute grade III 01 toxicity and another patient with acute grade III GU toxicity. Late morbidity analysis was only available in 66 patients. Severe late complications including fistula formation, urethral stricture, cystitis, proctitis were found in 9 patients (14%) which is higher than other reported series. Those patients who received RT after radical prostatectomy experienced a significant higher severe late complication rate than those who received RT alone. (44% vs 9%, p＜0.05). The overall survival rates for all patients are 67% at 5 years and 36% at 10 years. The cause-specific survivals for all patients are 66% at 5 years and 34% at 10 years. The local control rates are 83% for stage A and B, 90% for stage C and 50% for stage Dl patients in group I. The local control rate for group II patients is 100%. In univariate analysis, age, stage, pathology grading, hormone therapy and RT dose didn’t show significant impact on cause specific survivals.\\nConclusion: This study showed the local control rates after curative RT or radical prostatectomy followed by adjuvant RT are good. However, the complication rates after conventional two-dimensional RT are high. Further efforts in three-dimensional conformal RT for prostate cancer is highly recommended in term of decreasing toxicity.'},\n",

The results were analyzed for the endpoints of sphincter preservation, sphincter function, pelvic control, disease-free survival, overall survival and treatment-related morbidities.\\nMaterials and Methods: From 1992 to 1996, 43 patients with clinically resectable rectal cancer received preoperative radiotherapy at our department. All of these patients had undergone a prospective clinical assessment by their surgeons and were declared to require an abdominoperineal resection due to the proximity of the tumor to the anal sphincter. The whole pelvis received 37.5 Gy in daily fraction of 2.5 Gy with parallel opposed anterior-posterior portals.\\nResults: Thirty of the forty-three patients (70%) were able to undergo low anterior resection. The majority (88%) of patients had good sphincter function after sphincter-preserving surgery. The pathologic stage was T2 in 11 patients and T3 in 32 patients. The 3- year overall survival rate, disease-tree survival rate, and local control rate of the 43 patients were 60%, 62%, and 89%, respectively. In univariate analysis, pathologic stage and the presence of regional lymphadenopathy were noted as significant prognostic factors for both overall survival and disease-free survival. With regard to local control, only the presence of regional lymphadenopathy showed prognostic significance for local control. No difference in survival rate and local control rate was observed between patients undergoing low anterior resection and those undergoing abdominoperineal resection. In multivariate analysis, pathologic stage was noted as the only independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival; likewise, only the presence of lymphadenopathy was demonstrated as an independent predictor for local control. No clinical and pathologic parameters were proved to be independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Acute intestinal toxicity included grade 1 in 10 (23%) patients, grade 2 in 18 (42%) patients, and grade 3 in 2 patients (5%).

Materials and Methods: From 1979 to 1988, 46 adult patients with low grade astrocytoma received postoperative radiotherapy in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou Medical Center. The median age of these patients was 32 years old with the range from 15 to 63. There were 25 male and 21 female. According to the Kernohan's grading system, 10 patients' tumors belonged to grade 1 and the others belonged to grade 2. Eleven patients received total removal of tumors, 17 patients received subtotal excision of tumors, and 18 patients received biopsy only. All patients had good performance status (Karnofsky scale ＞ 70) after operation. For radiotherapy, the median total dose was 6000 cGy on each patient, ranging from 4400 to 6600 cGy. No patient received chemotherapy at the beginning.\\nResult: The overall 5 year survival was 49%. Female had better survival than male (54% vs 24%, p=O.O15). Younger patients had better results than older patients (47% vs 30%, p0.04). Patients with grade I tumors had better survival than patients with grade Ii tumors (69% vs 30%, p=O.O4). Patients received excision surgery had better survival rate (44% vs 32 %, p=0.05), but the extent of surgery did not make the difference. Total radiation dose did not significantly change the survival result. \\nDiscussion: The low grade astrocytoma patients showed poor survival rate after radiotherapy, especially for patients with grade II tumor. To properly treat patients with low-grade astrocytorma is a more important issue than to consider the incidence of radiation complications.\"},\n",

It consists of a flat and rigid acrylic plate and thermoplastic cast. Eight patients with pelvic cast were evaluated by on line electronic portal imaging during daily radiotherapy treatment for 5 to 8 consecutive days. While another 10 patients without pelvic casts were used as a control. A total of 221 electronic portal imaging (EPI) were reviewed. Under the assistance of image registration software, the geometric errors from the EPI was identified by interactive techniques.

They received bilateral parallel opposed fields or initial treatment. The thickness of head and neck was estimated from CT scan, the reference point of the thickness of head was defined at field center, and the reference points of the thickness of were defined at cross-section of C3-C4 interface, 2 cm from anterior margin of neck (reference point A), 3 cm anterior margin (reference point B). During simulation, the area with significant deficit was delineated, and was analyzed on CT scan. If the line along the anterior border of vertebral body was defined as the base of a triangle, we can find the base angle θ of anterior neck. Following measurcment and analysis of angle θ of different sections on CT scan, several sets of compensator were made.\\nResults: If the given dose was normalized at the center of radiation field, the average percentage of overdose of anterior neck was as following: reference point A, 13.7% (10.0~166.6) for tongue cancer, 7.4% (5.8~9.9) for hypopharyngeal cancer, 13.6% (12.4~14.4) for nasopharyngeal cancer; reference point B, 11.7% (9.5~14.7), 5.4% (4.0~6.7), and 10.1% (7.4~13.1) respectively.

Most of the patients were treated using Co-60 gamma irradiation. A Cs-137 teletherapy unit was used in 7% of the patients in the 60's. The median prescribed tumor dose was 70 GY with a range of 60~130 GY and the daily fraction size was 1.8-2.0 Gy, 5 fractions per week. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier actuarial method. Differences between survival curves were compared using the log rank test.\\nResults: The 5- and 10-year survivals are 53.0% and 30.9%, respectively. Patients receiving radical surgery before radiotherapy showed a better 5-year survival. The complete response rate is 30% and partial response rate is 22% in our study after radiotherapy. The overall local failure and distant metastasis rate are about 35% and 13%. No correlation could be made between the survival and histology, staging group, and sex in our study.

The maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were the most common primary tumor sites in our study (81.7% and 14.6%). Patients receiving radiotherapy alone had relative poor prognostic factors and the cure was not achieved by conventional radiotherapy alone in most patients. In view of the poor local control for advanced unresectable paranasal sinuses cancer and relative low morbidity with standard-dose irradiation, we have conducted cancer and relative low morbidity with standard-dose irradiation, we have conducted dose escalation using hyperfractionation regiment and CT based 3-D conformal treatment planning in recent years.

TORT-related complications due to high dose irradiation occurred in two patients (4%). \\nConclusion: The preliminary results suggested that IORT was a safe and feasible modality for abdominal pelvic malignancies at high risk for local recurrence. It was especially effective in relieving tumor pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Longer follow-up should be needed to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of this approach.'},\n",

The patients who were found to have extrapelvic extension at operation, palliative surgery at diagnosis, and incomplete data were excluded. Sixty patients were analyzable. All these 60 patients received potentially curative surgery at diagnosis. Adjuvant therapy with radiotherapy or chemotherapy was mainly decided by the surgeon. Recurrence of tumor was documented by physical examination, imaging studies such as CT scan or MRI, colonosoopy, CEA, or sonography. The salvage treatment of recurrent tumor included reoperation with curative or palliative intent, radiotherapy alone or with chemotherapy. Analysis of survival was calculated from the date of operation using Kaplan-Meier method. \\nResults: Of these 60 patients 2- and 5-year overall survival rate were 63% and 33%, respectively. Overall recurrence rate was 88%. The mean loco-regional recurrence time was 26 months vs. 21 months for distant metastasis. Only 5 patients with isoloated pelvic recurrence can be salvaged by reoperation with curative intent. The patients with recurrent cancer receiving palliative surgery survived at a median of 6 months. Seven patients with recurrent disease were salvaged with radiotherapy only. The patients with salvage surgery survived at a median of 16 months after diagnosis of recurrence vs. 8.5 months for patients with salvage radiotherapy only. Clinical variables such as age, gender, stage, tumor location, and tumor size had no statistically significant impact on survival. \\nConclusion: There was substantially high recurrence rate for patients with even potentially curative resection of primary rectal adenocarcinoma. A minority of patients with isolated local recurrence can be salvaged by aggressive reoperation with a relatively long survival.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To conduct a survey on the institutional manpower, patients, and treatment characteristics at the Department of Radiation Oncology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 1987-1996. Some of the survey items were compared with results of Patterns of Care Study (PCS) in the United States. \\nMethods and Materials: The database of 9785 radiotherapy (RT) patients registered in a personal computer-based cancer registry system between 1987 and 1996 was reviewed and analyzed. Major items of the survey included: new cases per annum (NCPA), patient referral, average patient load and its trends over time, disease patterns, treatment intent, treatment completion, fractionation patterns, and application of computer in the assistance of radiotherapy treatment planning. \\nResults: (1) The NCPA ranged from 458 to 1264, the mean being 1087. The number increased by year, and reached a plateau during the last four years. The crude rate of patient referral for RT was 30%. The referral rate in the two treatment periods, 1987-1991 and 1992-1996, increased mildly from 26% to 33%, respectively. (2) The average patient load (NCPA per personnel or machine) was as follows: radiation oncologist: 281 (range, 177-339); physicist: 350 (range, 280-466); technologist: 123 (range, 86-157); machine: 428 (range, 298-705). The patient load for personnel and machine declined overtime. (3) The five diseases most commonly treated were cancers of the lung (15.9%), cervix (14.5%), nasopharynx (13.1%, NPC), head/neck (12.2%, exclude NPC), recto-sigmoid (7.2%). Purely benign disorders accounted for about 1% of cases. (4) Pediatric patients of age ＜ 15 years accounted for 1.8% of cases. (5) Fifty-seven percent of patients were treated with curative-intent (definitive plus adjuvant). Twelve percent of patients were treated with salvage FIT for postsurgical recurrence. (6) The overall treatment completion rate was 76%. (7) Conventional fraction, 1.8-2 Gy/day, was used in 69% of patients. Twice-a-day (BID) scheme accounted for 1% of cases. (8) The application of computerized treatment planning increased by sixfold in the two treatment peroids, 1987-1992 and 1992-1996, respectively. There was an obvious trend toward a decreased use of two-dimensional planning and an increase of three-dimensional planning. \\nConclusion: Compared with the PCS survey, there was a similar trend toward a decline of average patient load for personnel and machine over time. The rate of cancer patients referral for radiotherapy was significantly lower than the PCS survey in the United States. Regarding the treatment, the BID scheme was rarely used throughout the period of the survey. The treatment completion rate and percentage of patients treated with curative intent appeared satisfactory and comparable with the result of PCS survey.'},\n",

Except from the two patients of rectal cancer, all of them were treated with four-field box technique and the principle of radiation technique was all the same in both groups. The portal films were taken from anterior-posterior and bilateral directions with the frequency of twice per week. There were 34 simulation films and 149 portal films to be evaluated.

We focus our study on equivalent doses, effective quality factors (Q) and effective radiation weighting factors (W(subscript R) ) by the dosimetric model. \\nResult: In low boron concentration, the relation between equivalent dose and boron concentration was nonlinear. At such concentration, when decreased, the radiation effects for tumor and normal tissues were approximately the same. The therapeutic effectiveness by BNCT was decreased. As boron concentration increased the relation became linear and the therapeutic effectiveness was better. \\nConclusion: A computer code was developed to calculate the dosimetric quantities from input of boron concentration, neutron flux and energy, irradiation geometry and time.

       "  'e': 'Introduction: When electron beams are used for radiotherapy, the treatment portals are often shaped to fit the treatment area. In some clinical application, a larger nominal gap is necessary. For these different applicator effects, we most determine empirically these effects for the applicator system employed. \\nMaterials and Methods: In this paper, a 10×10 cm^2 open cone, a 10 x 10 cone with 5 cm diameter circular cutout, and a 5 cm diameter open cane for 12 MeV, 80 MU electrons will be studied. Change the air gap between the collimator and the phantom surface from 0 cm to 10 cm. We measure parameters and compare these differences. \\nResults: When applicator is a 10×10 cm^2 open cone resulting in larger X-ray background, larger D(subscript max), G0 and flatness is better. If the applicator is a 10×10 cm^2 cone with 5 cm diameter circular cutout, the X-ray background is smaller. As the air gap between the collimator and the phantom surface increases the penumbra increases, X-ray background and scatters increase, too. We also find that the 10×10 cm^2 open cone for the effect of the air gap is larger. \\nConclusion: Electron beams with a 10×10 cm^2 open cone can be used to treat larger tumors. To treat smaller tumors, a 10 x 10 cm2 cone with 5 cm diameter circular cutout will be better. The flatness and effective treatment size of electron beams with a 10×10 cm^2. cone with 5 cm diameter circular cutout are better than with a 5 cm diameter open cone.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To study whether a xenogeneic cell line engineered to express the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) and/or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can be used as cellular vaccine to repress tumor growth.\\nMaterials and Methods: The HSVtk gene, murine GM-CSF gene, or both were stably transfected into the human cervix cancer cell line HeLa, thus creating three different cell lines designated as H-tk, H-gm, and H-tk/gm. The tumor model we tested was the KBALB sarcoma cells in syngenic BALB/c mice. For in vivo studies, equal number of KBALB cells and H-tk, H-gm, or H-tk/gm cells were premixed and injected into the right flanks of mice. The tumor growth was monitored after ganciclovir (GCV) administration.\\nResults: Two HSVtk-expressing clones (H-tk 2-3 and H-tk 12-2) were isolated. The established H-tk/gm or H-gm cell line was confirmed to express GM-CSF by supporting the growth of a GM-CSF-dependent cell line NSF6O. The right flank tumors in mice injected with premixed K-BALB and H-tk cells showed no definite growth retardation upon GCV administration. Further studies implied that the H-tk cells expressed HSVtk in the injection sites, but failed to confer bystander effect between homologous cells by in vitro studies. The right flanks of mice injected with premixed K-BALB and H-tk/gm or Hgm showed no detectable or much delayed tumor growth either with or without GCV administration; however, the left flank K-BALB tumor progressed with similar growth curve in each study group.\\nConclusion: Cur studies suggest that though HeLa cells can express HSVtk gene in vivo, they can not confer bystander killing effect to xenogeneic tumor (sarcoma) cells upon GCV administration. This might be because the HeLa cells are intrinsically resistant to metabolic cooperation with other cells. Local production of GM-CSF is able to suppress local tumor growth, but not potent enough to induce distant antitumor immunity. This inability might be related to insufficient duration or amount of GM-CSF action.'},\n",

Our study is to analyse the treatment outcome of cervical cancer in the past five years at Shin Kong Memorial Hospital. In order to refine future treatment protocol, the possible risk factors of late rectal complications will also be analysed.\\nMaterials & Methods: From September 1992 to December 1994, 109 patients with uterine cervical cancer completed planned radiotherapy (RT) at Shin Kong Memorial Hospital. Treatment consisted of external beam RT followed by HDR (high dose rate) intracavitary brachytherapy. After external RT dose of 40~44 Gy to whole pelvis, bilateral parametrium of stage (IIb cases were further boosted to 54~58 Gy with central shielding. Intracavitary brachytherapy consisted of three to four insertions with intervals of one week. The prescribed dose of each insertion was 7.2 Ely to point A, while in some circumstances (old age or high cumulative rectal dose), point A dose had been modified to 5-6 Gy. One hundred and two cases (24 Iv-IIa, 48 IIb, 26 IIIa-b, 4 IVa) received follow-up and were enrolled for the study.\\nResults: After 30 to 54 months of follow-up (median 39 months), 65 cases was alive (one was noted to have distant metastasis), 37 cases died of disease (8 for local reurrence, 16 for distant metastasis, one for both), 3 cases died of complication, while 9 cases were dead due to intercurrent disease. The 3-year cause-specific survival and local control rates are 95%/95% for Ib-IIa, 84%/92% for IIb, 50%/78% for IIIa-b, 25%/50% for stage IV, respectively. A total of 86 cases who survived more than one year were further analysed to define the risk factors of late gastrointestinal complication. Twenty-six patients (30.2%) was noted to have late rectal sequale (RTOG gradeI 14, gradeI 8, gradeIII-IV 4), while four cases (4.6%) developed ileus. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a high risk of late rectal sequale in those who were stage IIb-IV cases, total rectal dose (external RT+total ICRU rectal dose)＞65 Gy, and overall treatment time＞70 days.\\nConclusion: Our current study show the treatment outcome of Figo IIIa-tub cases is not satisfactory. Because 18 patients (17.6%) were noted to have distant metastases, it might be recommended to select high risk patients to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy. With our present tratment proctocol, there will be about 30% of cases to have different extent of radiation proctitis.

To investigate the shielding effect of lead sheet and rubber bolus and evaluate the availability on practical treatment.\\nMaterials and Methods: We develop mono-isocenter tangential technique. Two tangential fields was applied to treat patient's breast, chest wall, internal mammary chain and axillary lymph nodes. The supraclavicular lymph nodes were treated with a supraclavicular field. 11 stage III, IV post-mastectomy patients were enrolled in our study. TLDs were placed on their contralateral breast for dosage evaluation with the following condition: (1) without rubber bolus or lead sheet, (2) with lead sheet, (3) with rubber bolus. The prescribe dose was 180 cGy daily.\\nResults: We found that the to contralateral breast was 11±1.9 cGy daily, when there is no shielding.

While 0.3cm and 0.5cm lead sheet were added, the doses decreased to 2.7±0.2 cGy and 2.6±0.2 cGy, respectively. Therefore, while the total dose reach 5040 cGy, the dose to contralateral breast was estimated as 332 cGy. Adding a 2cm bolus or 0.5cm lead sheet will effectively reduce the dose to 80 cGy and 73 cGy, respectively, which eliminate approximately 75% scatter radiation doses.\\nConclusion: Rubber bolus is usually used for increasing body surface dose during radiation therapy. This study indicated that rubber bolus can decrease the doses to contralateral breast when a tangential field technique is applied. Rubber bolus is a material which can be easily available, and proved to effectively reduce the dose of contralateral breast, it is also easy to fix on patient's chest wall, so we encourage the usage of bolus during radiation therapy for breast cancer.\"},\n",

We report a case of an 80-year-old male patient with a nasal cavity tumor. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery was performed and the pathology revealed inverted papilloma and sarcomatoid carcinoma. This combination has not previously been reported. Radiotherapy was administrated because of advanced disease, inadequate surgical margins, and the unique pathological findings. A 3-field technique was used, with a total dose to 5940 cGy. No recurrence was noted.

The treatment were carried out by a microSelectron-HDR afterloading device with lridium-192 radiation source and a special catheter which was  designed for esophageal applications. One patient was treated by a treatment volume including the middle third of the esophagus, 9cm in length, the prescribed dose point was one cm in depth from the central axis of the source. The total treatment dose was 2000 cGy in 10 fractions within 2 weeks. The brachytherapy for another patient was arranged to cover the upper part of the esophageal tumor with 2cm in length and the prescribed dose point was one cm in depth. The total treatment dose was 2000 cGy in 4 fractions within 12 days.\\nResults The symptoms of the first patient had improved after the first 5 fractions of HDR treatments. He could eat liquid diet after this treatment but odynophagia occurred. Two months later, he expired due to tumor bleeding and cachexia. After 2 fractions of intracavitary brachytherapy, the second patient could swallow some saliva, and the NO tube could be inserted more deeply. He felt better due to less production of saliva after treatment. He expired due to pneumonia in two months.

The purpose of this prospective phase II study is to evaluate the feasibility, response and toxicities of accelerated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).\\nMaterials and Methods: Through December 1992 to December 1995, 43 patients with pathologically documented NPC were entered. There were 32 male and 11 female with a median age of 51 years (range 28-78). The pathology of most patients (91%) belongs to WHO type II and III. According to 1988 AJCC staging system, 37 patients (86.1%) were stage IV, 5 (11.6%) stage III, and 1(2.3%) stage II. The accelerated radiotherapy consists of 1.5 Gy/fraction, two fractions per day, with at least a 6-hour interval. The total dose is usually 72 Gy/48 fractions in 5 weeks.\\nResults: The major toxicities were mucositis and skin reaction. Grade 3/4 mucositis occurred in 24 patients (55.8%) and grade 3/4 skin reaction in 26 patients (60.5%). Eleven patients asked to change to conventional radiotherapy (1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction, one fraction per day) during the later part of radiotherapy, and 2 patients had interruption for 2 and 4 weeks. Although the original accelerated schedule in 13 patients were modified, all patients completed the treatment with average dose 72 Gy/47 fractions/38 days (range 67.5-79 Gy). After a median follow-up time of 41 months (range 24-60), the nasopharynx disease-free, neck disease-free, and distant metastasis disease-free survivals are 86.6%, 97.3%, and 71.2% respectively. The 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival are 54.1% and 65.7%. Most patients failed due to distant metastases.\\nConclusion: Our data indicate that accelerated radiotherapy for advance NPC is both feasible and effective, with acceptable toxicities. Post-radiation adjuvant chemotherapy to eradicate subclinical micrometastasis should be further studied.\\n［Therapeut Radiol Oncol 1997; 4:243-249］'},\n",

Radiotherapy has become the standard local treatment for NPC, and failure in completion of the treatment will almost lose the chance for cure. There are few articles to explore and analyze the reasons why NPC patients interrupted or even refused the radiotherapy treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate the problem.\\nMaterial and Methods: There are 2,860 NPC cases registered in Radiation Oncology Department of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 1979 to 1994. Two hundred and fifty-nine patients did not complete their treatment after registration. The survey from hospital records, telephone or mail contacts were used to analyze the reasons why these patients escaped from the treatment of local irradiation.\\nResults: One hundred and fifteen (44.4%) in these 259 patients cannot tolerate the acute reactions of the treatment or fear for the thought of the expected long-term sequels. Fifty-two patients (20.1%) had poor general condition, or psychologically ignored the disease. Forty-eight patients tried alternative treatments instead of the radiotherapy and seventeen suffered from economic problem. The last 14 patients either lacked the support from family or converted to have chemotherapy only by the referring physician.\\nConclusion: Adverse effect of radiation therapy in NPC is one of the important reasons to causing the cessation of the treatment. Alternative treatments are another motivation causing interruption of local treatment. Fail to have faith on the curable by radiotherapy and fear for the complications remained the main causes of interruption. It is important to encourage and help the NPC patients and their family to go through the local treatment.\\n[Therapeut Radiol Oncol 1997; 4:251-257]'},\n",

The duties of radiation oncology nurse included outpatient clinic service, brachytherapy care, patient education, cancer registration, chemotherapy service, nutritional consultation, patient's treatment arrangement etc. The number of full time nurses in the departments ranged from 2 to 12. The nurses have the duty of chemotherapy service in 5 hospitals. Only two departments have annual qualified examination for the nurses.\\nConclusion：Most of the department chairmen have complained the manpower of nurses are not enough for the daily duties. The Oncology Nursing Society and Radiation Oncology Society should have the responsibility to establish the standard of nursing care in the department of radiation oncology. Hence, the hospital administrators will conform to this standard to adjust the manpowers in the department of radiation oncology.\\n[Therapeut Radiol Oncol 1997；4:285-289]\"},\n",

The information is mostly derived from site visits to several modern facilities in the United States and Japan.\\nDescription: The use of accelerating proton beams to effectively control solid tumors and arteriovenous malformations is one of the major breakthroughs that combine physics, biology and engineering for medicine in the twentieth century. In the past, the clinical outcomes of proton therapy by use of proton beams at physics laboratories have already been recognized by the medical community. More recent advances including the building of accelerator facility within a hospital and the development of isocentric beam delivery gantry permit the 3D physical dose distribution to reach its ever optimum status.\\nConclusions: The accelerator of a proton therapy facility can be selected from a linear accelerator, a cyclotron, or a synchrotron. The latter two kinds of accelerators are the current choices for hospital use and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. In addition to an accelerator, beam extraction and transport system, beam delivery system, and patient positioning system are all integral parts of the facility. Further, treatment planning system, quality control and radiation safety measures are essential for the operation.\\n[Therapeut Radiol Oncol 1997; 4:291-297]'},\n",

       "  'c': '前言：晚期的會陰部腫瘤常會合併有腹股淋巴結的轉移，因此腹股淋巴結的治療對處理晚期的會陰部腫瘤佔有非常重要的角色。若放射治療給予腹股淋巴結足夠的輻射劑量及深度，控制率幾乎會和手術有一樣的效果且副作用較小。但治療太深以致於腹股溝的劑量太高時卻又有增加股關節骨折的危險。因此如何拿捏治療效用(therapeutic ratio)，是用放射線來治療腹股溝淋巴結的重要課題。我們做了婦女腹股淋巴結深度的分析，並探討可能較好的治療方式。\\n材料及方法：我們隨機抽驗65位在放射腫瘤科接受放射治瘴的婦癌患者，檢視其四條股血管的深度來代表腹股淋巴結的可能深度。另外我們使用電腦計劃系統來計算不同能量的光子射線、電子射線及不等比重之光子、電子之組合所得之劑量分布情況。\\n結果：經過測量，65位女病人的腹股淋巴結可能的深度，從1至6.5公分，平均是2.49公分。中間值為3.75公分。最深處從2.5至8.8公分，平均是4.46公分，中間值是5.65公分。在治療3公分以下的深度，電子射線或許是不錯的選擇。要治療5公分的厚度以上時，使用10-12 MeV電子射線合併6 MV光子射線，可以在5公分後，劑量便下降了20%以上的能量，而能使股關節的輻射劑量不會太高。\\n結論：腹股溝淋巴結的放射治療需要做個別的考量，因不同的厚度做不同方式的治療，以期達到最佳的治療效果，同時能有最小的副作用。',\n",
       "  'e': 'Purpose: irradiation to inguinal lymph node had a very important role to treat advanced stage perineal tumor for it had high incideoce of inguinal lymph node metastasis. It needs great caution to irradiate the ingoinal area. To irradiate with inadequate depth will cause poor control rate but too deep will lead risk of femoral head or neck fracture. We evaluate the depth of inguinal lymph nodes and propose the possible better irradiation method.\\nMaterial and Methods: We reviewed the CT films of sixty-five gynecological cancer patients who received radiotherapy to find the possible depth of inguinal nodes - the depth of four femoral vessels. We also calculated the irradiation dose distribotion by using different energy of photon beam, electron beam and various combination of photon and electron beams.\\nResults: The most superficial depth of inguinal lymph node ranged from 1 cm to 6.5 cm; the median was 3.75 and the mean was 2.49 cm. The most deep depth of inguinal lymph node ranged from 2.5 to 8.8 cm; the median was 5.65 cm and the mean was 4.46 cm. Using the photon beam to treat the inguinal will cause too much radiation dose to femoral head area. High energy electron was a good choice to treat the lesion with 3 cm depth without too much hot spot. To treat the depth of 5 cm, using the combination of 6 MV photon beam and high energy electron beam can get much homogenous dose distribution but also can reduce more than 20 % of dose to the femoral head area.\\nConclusion: It needs individual treatment plan according to the different depth to irradiate the inguinal lymph node area. To treat with appropriate depth with proper radiation modality not only can get good control but also to reduce the complication as much as possible.'},\n",

According to the orientation of the source axis in the applicator, it can be divided into two kinds: horizontal and vertical ones. There are three kinds of diameter for each type of applicator: 1, 2 and 3 cm. Five characteristics of the applicator will be measured for clinical application. They are geometric structure, relative output, percent depth dose, isodose curve distributions and real sagittal plane radiation leakage test.\\nMaterials and Methods: High accuracy calipers was used to measure the geometric structure of the applicator The relative outputs were measured with N.E. 0.03 cc. parallel-plate ionization chamber connected to Ionex Dosemaster 2590 in RMI solid phantom with 3 mm build-up layer The outputs were normalized to the dose in full phantom that was measured at the same source-to-chamber distance. The percentage depth dose and isodose curve distributions were measured with Scanditronix RFA300 water phantom connected to p-type electron beam semiconductor chamber The measurement was performed in water along the side Mylar window. The real sagittal plane radiation leakage of the applicator was measured with Kodak V film that was cut according to the shape of the applicator.\\nResults: The relative outputs of the horizontal type were increased 10%, while the vertical ones were decreased 9%. The effective source-to-surface distance of the horizontal type is equal to 1.93 cm and 1.74 cm for the vertical ones. The isodose curves are attenuated in the central axis of vertical type applicators due to the attenuation from catheter and source tip. The hot spots of the horizontal type applicators are located at the top of the applicator and at the sides for the vertical ones. The leakage is 30% for the horizontal types and 20% for the vertical types.\\nConclusion: Leipzig applicators can be used to treat some small volume cancer such as skin cancer, oral cancer and for other dose boost treatment. The dose can be estimated with BSSD to approximately 20% depth accurately. The hot spots of the applicators allow the user to avoid unnecessary exposure.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To test the performance of interstitial microwave antenna array hyperthermia system using a phantom model with or without flow effect\\nMaterial and Method: The heating device was a custom-made interstitial microwave antenna array hyperthermia system. Six 2450-MHz antennas which were implanted on the corners of a hexagon with intercather spacing of 15 mm were used in this system. A phantom with flow was designed, namely, one silicone tube inserted into a homogenons muscle phantom. The temperature data from four fibrooptic thermometers were fed to the personal computer which could record and analyze the data, also could control the output power of microwave source. To test the system performance, we devided the study into two stages. In the first stage, the thermal distribution in a phantom without flow was conducted. In the second stage, the experiments in a phantom with different flow rates (25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 ml/min) were designed. The flow rates of water through silicone tubes were controlled by a microtube pump.\\nResult: Using the automatic temperature and power control in this interstitial microwave antenna array hyperthermia system, the temperature distribution in phantom can be maintained uniformly in the range of 43-45 DC. The first-stage study showed that there was a tendency that the temperature was concentrated around the antennas. For the flow effect on thermal distribution, the results demonstrated that the faster flow rate would take more energy away in the transient period. However, the rate of energy loss caused by flowing water became constant when the flow rate was faster than l00ml/min.\\nConclusions: An interstitial microwave antenna array hyperthermia system for deep-seated heating was developed. The superior ability of this system in maintaining uniform temperature distribution around the heating area was also clearly demonstrated.'},\n",

Patients were grouped according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Among these 161 patients, 33 (20%) were categorized as stage I; 53 (33%) stage II; 37 (23%) stage III and 38 (24%) stage IV. All of them were squamous cell carcinoma with a male to female ratio of approximately 4:1. The treatment results of primary control, neck node control, outcomes and complications were analyzed.\\nResults: More than four fifths of the lesions were located on the lateral border of the tongue and less than 5% were either on the dorsum or undersurface. Primary control rates of Ti and T2 diseases in the OP alone group were 90% and 86%, respectively. The T3 patients of OP+REF group had better primary control rate as 67%. Primary control of T4 disease was very poor hi our three treatment groups. Even for the early disease, patients receiving surgical resection of primary tumor without further neck treatment have a higher risk (28%) of neck failure. Five-year survival rates of stage Ⅲ patients were: R/T alone, 17%; OP alone, 24%; OP+R/T, 61%. Eighty-four percent and 72% recurrence in T3/T4 and T1/T2, respectively, occurred within one year after treatment. Overall, 86% recurrence occurred within the first 2 years. Sixteen patients (10%) showed evidence of distant metastasis; most commonly presented in the lung (75%). The risk of osteonecrosis was similar between OP+R/T group (6%) and R/T alone group (3%).\\nConclusion: In our study, surgery can control primary tumors effectively in Ti and T2 lesions. Advanced (T3 and T4) disease is unlikely to be cured by radiation therapy or surgery alone and therefore is best managed by a planned combination of surgery and radiation therapy. For stageⅢ group, five-year survival rate was significantly improved (p＜O.O5) for patients who were treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy.

The calculation of dose volume histograms is straightforward if there are an adequate number of CT scans and dose distributions for organs of interest. The effective volume method transforms the histogram into a uniform one of height (effective volume) and dose (D(subscript max))equal to the maximum dose in the histogram. NTCP can be obtained using Lyman's model and table of the normal distribution.\\nResults: Dose volume histograms for various organs are obtained by calculation with Render-Plan treatment planning system. Effective volumes for these organs are obtained by calculation with Kutcher's effective volume method. Calculation using Lyman's model and table of the normal distribution, we obtained the NTCP values for these organs.\\nConclusion During radiotherapy normal tissues are irradiated along with the tumor. Radiation oncologists try to minimize the dose to normal tissues while delivering a high dose to the tumor. Often this is difficult and complications arise due to irradiation of normal tissues. Estimation of NTCP is important for evaluation of 3-dimensional treatment plans. It is preferable to use NTCP as an additional tool for plan evaluation, in conjunction with a review of graphical dose distributions and dose volume histograms.\"},\n",

       "  'e': 'Purpose: To evaluate the therapeutic results of stage Ⅲ and IV advanced endometrial carcinoma treated at Mackay Memorial Hospital over the past ten years. To address the future direction in the management of this disease.\\nMaterials and methods: From July 1985 to June 1996, 174 patients with pathologically proven endometrial cancer were registered. All patients were staged according to the 1988 FIGO staging system. There were 25 cases with stage Ⅲ disease and 4 patients with stage IV disease. The median age was 57 years with a range of 40-79 years. Abnormal vaginal bloody discharge (21/29) was the most common symptom. Twenty-eight patients received a surgical approach initially. Seventeen patients received adjuvant radiotherapy to the whole pelvis with doses ranging from 5040 cGy to 5940 cGy and vaginal cuff irradiation with doses ranging from 2000 cGy to 3000 cGy, respectively. The follow-up period ranged from 2.5 months to 161.3 months. The acturial five-year cumulative survival rate was evaluated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and significance was calculated according to the Gehans General Wilcoxan test.\\nResults: Restaging showed 14 cases with stage ⅢA disease, 11 with stage ⅢC, 1 with stage IVA and 3 with stage IVB. The overall 5-year survival for all patients was 48.3%, and for stage Ⅲ patients was 52%. There were four patients with stage IV disease, three of them died during the follow-up. In addition, the overall 5- year survival rate was statistically higher in grade 1 and 2 than in grade 3 in superficial myometrial invasion and in the radiation group. Older aged patients did have a lower 5-year survival rate but it was not statistically significant.\\nConclusion: In patients with solitary extrauterine involvement, whole pelvis irradiation results in better survival. Gross adaexic involvement, para-aortic lymph node metastases and poordifferentiation or clear cell or papillary serous carcinoma have a more aggressive character, and so pelvic irradiation only as adjuvant therapy is inadequate. Therefore further aggressive therapy including extended-field irradiation, whole abdominal irradiation, hormonal therapy and chemotherapy should be considered.'},\n",

The treatment beam line consists of a beam spreading system, range modulator and beam and dose monitoring diagnostics. Treatment planning is similar to conventional 3-D photon and electron radiotherapy. The dose calculation algorithm used is based on a ray-tracing method which assumes that protons penetrate dense media following straight paths. The proton multiple scattering effects are implicitly included in the algorithm by incorporating measured lateral beam data. Measured central axis depth dose data is also incorporated into the algorithm to model the energy loss process along defined proton ray paths. The well-known relationship between CT number and electron density (i.e. stopping power) of tissues was measured for our CT scanner and the data were then used to connect the input depth dose for tissue heterogeneities along proton ray paths. \\nResults and Discussion: A linear relationship between CT number and electron density over the range of interest was defined by direct measurements. The advantage of the chosen ray-tracing method lies in its short calculation time while maintaining a clinically acceptable point dose accuracy. An example calculation for a coplanar three field treatment technique was demonstrated.

S-phase fraction (SPF) as well as ploidy status of a tumor, for example, has been used frequently for prognosis and treatment guidance in clinic. The kinetics of a tumor before and after the treatment plays an important role which may affect the outcome of the therapy. For a tumor with high SPF, either the cytotoxic drugs specific for S- or M-phase cells should be used in chemotherapy or the accelerated treatment should be adopted in radiotherapy. There are two kinds of drugs currently used for clinical chemotherapy. One of which can inhibit the activity of the enzyme required for DNA replication, such as 5-fluorouracil which kills S-phase cells by inhibiting the activity of thymydylate synthetase. The second one killed M-phase cells by destructing the organelle required for mitotic processes, such as vinblastine which breaks tubulin assembly and cyclophosphamide which results in fragmentation of synaptonemal complex. Radiotherapy, on the other way, is more effective in killing G2/M cells but less effective for S-phase cells. Both treatments, however, are not very effective for hypoxic cells, which in average accounts for 15% of solid tumors, and those cells in the GJG0 stage.

However, there is no direct evidence that EB virus is the etiological cause of NPC. There are many Chinese medicinal herbs and foods containing ES virus inducers and tumor promoters in NPC high risk areas. Many anaerobic bacteria producing butyric acid could also be found in the nasopharynces. Both of them together with ED virus may play an important role in the development of NPC.\\nMethods: The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) gene of RB virus contained in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (CNE1, CNE3) was detected by in situ hybridization, PCR amplification, cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis.Immortalized 293 (human fetal kidney cells) transfected with CR2 were infected with B95-8 REV. These cells were transplanted into nude mice sub cutaneously. A week later, each mouse was injected with 5Ong TPA subcutaneously. In another experiment, nude mice were subcutaneously transplanted with human fetal nasopharygeal mucosa infected with REV. 200ug butyrate and 50ng TPA were injected subcutaneously once a week following the tramplantation. Tumors were examined histopathologcally. The presence of EBV DNA were determined by PCR, in situ hybridization, and nucleotide sequence analysis of EBV LMP-1 gene.\\nResults: LMP1 gene is integrated into the No.1 chromosome in CNE1, and into several chromosomes in CNE3. The exon 3 of LMP1 gene was amplified by PCR and cloned from CNE1 and CNE3. Sequence analyses of these PCR products revealed a high homology of 99.5% between B95-8 strain and CNE1, and a lower homology of 93% between B95-8 and CNE3. Poorly differentiated carcinoma was found in nude mice transplanted with EBV infected 293 cells under the influence of TPA. Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma was also found in nude mice transplanted with RBV-infected human fetal nasopharyngeal mucosa by synergistic effect of TPA and butyrate. EB virus existed in all of these carcinoma cells.\\nConclusion: The present data demonstrated for the first time that the synergistic effect of RB virus and tumor promoter can induce nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

       "  'c': \"目的：本文擬報告鼻咽癌病人以多分次放射照射法治療後，所發生的急慢性副作用，以作為臨床醫師選擇治療法時之參考。\\n材料與方法：自民國八十年十月起至八十五年六月止，共給予五十例鼻咽癌病例使用多分次放射照射法，其中男病人35例、女病人15例。除兩例外均為AJCC第三或第四期。年齡自17至79歲不等，中值為51歲。治療採每日兩次間隔六小時。原發腫瘤一般在55-60天內給與7500-8000 cGy。治療中病人每週至少固定檢查一次，並將急性副作用詳細作成記錄記載於特別之表格。治療結束後每次回診，均詳細記錄病人之延發性晚期副作用。所有副作用之分級均按RTOG/EORTC之標準。\\n結果：急性副作用方面，口乾最普遍，沒有一人倖免。口腔黏膜炎則出現在96%的病人，其中有62%為第三級。20例出現惡心嘔吐，除一例為嚴重的第三級之外，其餘屬輕微。頸部照射部位皮膚潰爛出現在8例。白血球減少並不常見而且大多為輕微降低。體重減輕平均降幅為8.2±0.6%。晚期副作用仍以口乾最常見，所有病人均受其苦。頭部軟組織纖維化的有13人(26%)，不過大多為輕微之第一級，出現Lhermitte's sign的有12個病人，此外並沒有出現其它神經症狀。聽力減退與中耳炎及鼻塞也有約五分之一左右的病人出現，牙關緊閉有兩例。另外有一例出現右下齒槽骨壞死。\\n結論：多分次放射治療用於鼻咽癌病人，引發的急性口腔黏膜炎比率頗高，但並不致因此妨礙了治療進行。其它的急性副作用，基本上均屬輕微，或者與傳統治療法相當，病人所承受因治療帶來的壓力，似並不比傳統照射高。在晚期副作用方面，除一人發生骨壤死屬較嚴重的例子，其餘的副作用均屬一般傳統照射的範圍。不過仍需進一步追蹤，才能對於晚期副作用，作更準確的結論。在目前的階段，多分次放射治療理論上應不會增加晚期副作用、但會增加早期反應（及腫瘤控制率）的優點，若謹慎使用，不失為鼻咽癌病人在傳統照射法之外的另一選擇。\",\n",
       "  'e': \"Purpose: To analyze the treatment-related acute and late toxicities of NPC patients after hyperfractionated radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: During the period from Oct. 1991 to June 1996, 50 patients were treated using hyperfractionated radiotherapy with 120 cGy bid and 6-hour intervals. There were 35 males and 15 females with the age range of 17-79. All except 2 cases were of AJCC stage III & IV. During the treatment period, acute toxicities were recorded once a week. Late toxicities were also evaluated on every follow-up visit after completion of radiotherapy. RTOG/EORTC criteria are used to grade toxicities.\\nResults: Dry mouth was the most commonly found acute side effect affecting all patients. Acute mucositis developed in 96% of the patients, with 62% of grade 3. Nausea/vomiting occurred in 20 cases and were mostly mild except one. Moist desquamation was noted in 8 patients. Leukopenia was not frequent and mild. Body weight loss was 8.2±0.6%. For late toxicities, xerostomia was again the most common and affected all patients. Neck fibrosis was found in 13 patients (26%), mostly mild. Twelve patients developed Lhermitte's sign. No other neurological dysfunction has been noted. Hearing impairment was often associated with otitis media and occurred in about 1/ 5 of patients. Two patients had trismus, and one had radionecrosis at the posterior alveolar bone of the right mandible.\\nConclusions: Hyperfractionated radiotherapy induced a high proportion of mucositis. However, the patient tolerance was not compromised by this. Other acute toxicities resembled that after conventional radiotherapy both in frequency and severity. This also applied to late complications except one case with radionecrosis. Longer follow-up is needed before any definite conclusion can he made. At the present stage, hyperfractionated radiotherapy, with its theoretical advantages, appears to be a reasonable alternative to conventional radiotherapy for NPC patients.\"},\n",

The ID50 data of AA on KB and CHO cells are 2.48 and 2.11 mg/ml of culture medium respectively, roughly the same of them. The survival fractions (SF) of KB cells increased gradually after delivered AA to their culture medium at 0, 24 and 48 hrs, and then irradiated with a single fraction of 800 cGy. Similar results were also noted in CHO cells. In general, the longer of the culture period, the higher of the SF after irradiation at that culture time. Compared to the SF of group B (0 hr), there was no significant increase of SF at 24 and 48 hrs in CHO treated KB cells. It showed that there was no radioprotective effect of AA on KB cells. On the contrary, the SF of CHO cells treated with AA at 24 and 48 hrs respectively increased significantly compared to the SF of group B.\\nConclusion: The radioprotective effects of AA on CHO cell were proportional to culture time within 48 hrs after AA treatment. This radioprotective effect was not significant in KB cells, but was significant in CHO cells. The differential radioprotective effect of AA on normal cells may be used in clinical radiotherapy.'},\n",

Problems of interference of heat delivery and temperature measurement exist when we use microwave or radiofrequency as the heating source, This study aims at investigating the heat distribution using interstitial thermofuse system.\\nMaterial and Methods: Thermofuse hyperthermia system was used to study on phantom, pork and alive pigs. Volume needle implantation with 3-5 planes, 5 needles per plane were implanted. They were devided into 3 groups with 10, 12 and 15mm needle spacing. Thermocouples were used to measure the temperature distribution inside and outside implantation areas. The data were analyzed and compared.\\nResults: In the study of phantom, pork and alive pigs, the implantation volume could achieve ideal and effective hyperthermia temperatures at 10, 12 mm spacing through the adjustment of water temperature before circulation. In alive pigs, with a 15 mm needle spacing, the implanted volume could not achieve ideal temperatures. The temperatures were significantly decreased by 1.4-2.0℃in the areas near the vessels.\\nConclusion: This study shows that interstitial hyperthermia using thermofuse system is able to precisely provide effective hyperthermia temperature without the interference of physics parameters in thermo-measurement in implanted tumor areas. The accuracy of heat delivery and temperature measurement is better than other external hyperthermia systems. We estimate that the combination with radiotherapy can improve the treatment effect of solid tumors.

A homogenous muscle phantom was used. Before heating, one capacitive plate electrode was placed under the phantom and another intracavitary electrode was inserted horizontally to the center of the phantom. The temperatures were measured by thin-coated thermocouples which were placed into the phantom through angiocatheters. The catheters were arranged with the aid of a custom-made holder. Simultaneously, thermogram was performed via a computerized system.\\nResult: The result showed that the temperatures around the intracavitary device were higher than the points elsewhere in the phantom. The farther away from the intracavitary electrode a point was, the less temperature was measured. The highest temperature appeared at the anterior part of the intracavitary electrode.\\nConclusion The study revealed that the energy would concentrate around the intracavitary electrode. It may be reasonable applying an intracavitary heating device into the body cavity to treat the malignancy of vagina, cervix, esophagus, prostate, etc. However, it must be very careful to monitor the temperature around the intracavitary electrode for prevention of normal tissue injury by overheating.'},\n",

In this study, we measured the output factors of each electron energy and each electron cone (except 25× 25 cm^2 applicator) of Varian Cl-l800 sn: 164 linear accelerator. The cut-out size is ranging from l×1 cm^2 to l0×10 cm^2 stepped by 1 cm for l0×10 cm^2 and 6×6 cm^2 electron cones and 15×15 cm^2 for 20×20 cm^2 cone.

Materials & Methods: Cut-out BSBs(Beam-Shaping-Blocks) were made of CERROBEND alloy to put into the frame of each applicator. The output was measured with 0.0 3cc parallel plate ionization chamber be setted at the dmax of RMI PMMA solid phantom and connected to lonex Dosemaster 2590 electrometer.

Combined surgery and radiotherapy were used to treat pituitary macroadenoma and recurrent pituitary adenoma. The object of this study was to investigate the survival rate and prognostic factors using combined surgery and radiotherapy.\\nMaterials and Methods: Between 1983 and 1993, 47 patients with pathologically proven pitiuitary adenoma received radiation therapy at Mackay Memorial Hospital. Of these patients, 25 were males and 22 were females. The median age was 42.5 years with a range of 21 to 71 years. Visual disturbance (72%) and headache (60%) were the most common symptoms. Irradiation was delivered with 6-MV photon or Co-60 gamma ray, 5 days per week, at a dose of 180 to 200 cGy per fraction. The total tumor dose ranged from 4140 cGy to 6500 cGy with a median dose of 5800 cGy. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 11 years with a median time of 5.6 years.\\nResults: 47 patients were divided into two groups by their tumor status before radiation therapy. Group A patients, consisting of 42 patients were underwent incomplete resection and radiation therapy as the primary treatment. Among these patients, 4 patients were lost during follow-up, and 3 patients experienced recurrence of the tumor. Five patients died during the follow-up period, 4 patients for uncontrolled disease and one patient for CVA. The overall 5-year survival rate was 87% and the relapse-free survival rate was 93%. Group (B) patients, cansisting of 5 patients were treated for recurrence after surgery. Of these patients, one died due to tumor compression 124 months after radiotherapy, but the remaining 4 cases are still doing well.\\nConclusions: Using the Log-rank test, gender, age and dose are not significant prognostic factors. In brief, we found that appropriate surgery and postoperative radiation therapy could achieve good local control and may replace radical surgery as the standard treatment for pituitary macroadenoma.'},\n",

The goal of this study was to increase our understanding of the relative influence that specific variables have on the outcome of patients.\\nMethods and Materials: Forty-two patients with intracranial malignant gliomas (17 with anaplastic astrocytomas and 25 with glioblastoma multiforme), treated by surgery and postoperative radiotherapy at Mackay Memorial Hospital from April 1985 through April 1995, were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-six men and 16 women with a median age of 44 years (range, 10 to 70 years) were entered in the study. Seventeen clinical factors (age at surgery; sex; initial presenting symptoms of headaches, mental changes, seizure, visual changes, motor deficits, sensory changes, and speech difficulties; preoperative performance status based on the Karnofsky scale; the extent of surgical removal; postoperative radiotherapy dose; the presence of brain edema, brain midline shift, and hematoma formation; tumor she; duration of initial symptoms), and 2 histological factors (histological grade; tumor cystic formation) were analyzed to investigate their importance in predicting length of survival. Data were analyzed using the Cox proportional harzards analysis or Chi-square test.\\nResults: The overall median survival time was 18.7 months. The median survival time was 25.4 months for anaplastic astrocytoma and 14.2 months for glioblastoma multiforme Four pretreatment variables including histological grade, age, sex and the extent of tumor resection (subtotal or total) were found to have a statistically significant effect on survival when analyzed together by the Cox multivariate regression model. Univariate analysis by the Chi-square test identified the presenting neurological symptoms of mental changes and motor deficits as having an adverse effect on survival.\\nConclusions: The authors conclude that histological grade, age, sex, extent of tumor resection, and the presenting symptoms of mental changes or motor deficits were important prognostic parameters in malignant gliomas. By stratifying patients into more homogeneous subgroups with favorable or unfavorable prognostic factors, treatment can be specially tailored for different subgroups.'},\n",

This study is to set up the quality assurance program and to evaluate our own data about radiation protection, shielding, possible radiation leakage and measurement to increase the radiation safety for patients as well as staffs. Laksell Gamma Unit (Model B) with 4 different sized interchangable collimator helmets, individual collimator plugs and different detector including ion chambers, LiF thermoluminescent dosimeter chips, verification films, spherical polystyrene phantom and survey meters were used for exposure and absorbed dose measurement, The radiation leakage measurements around, above and beneath the treatment room were background readings which were below the limits established by NCRP Report 49. This study will provide not only the data and rules to follow for the radiation safety in our center, but also the reference data for other hospitals when they install similar facilities in the coming days.'},\n",

       "  'e': 'Seral IgA titer to gene products of Epstein-Barr virus is prevalently elevated in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, an indication of EBV infection. Pathologically, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes that could be attracted by the presence of EBY in the NPC cells also increased immensely in the neighborhood of tumor nest. In a glance, EBV seemed to induce both cellular and humoral immune response. However, the immunocompetence of patients inversely decreased following the progression of the disease.\\nInterleukin-l0 (IL-l0), a potent cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor, suppresses function of T cells and NK cells ns well as that of monocytes and macrophages, the major components of cellular immune response. Besides its suppression on cellular immunity, IL-b stimulates B cells to enhance their viability, cell proliferation, class II MHC expression and immunoglobulin secretion, a hallmark of humoral immune response. Interestingly, sequence of a EBV late gene, UCIIF1, is highly homologous to that of both mouse and human IL-10(BCRF1 gene product is now designated as vIL-10). It may exert a similar function like that of JL-10. The activity of vIL-10 may explain the unusual seral phenomena and the aggregated non-functional lymphocytes surrounding the tumor nest. Anthor factor affecting the cellular immunity is the presence of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) that will compete with the membrane-bound IL-2R and desensitize the immune response. With these leads, the authors will discuss the subject ”the role of Epstein-Barr virus infection and the immunocompetence of patients with nasopharyngeal cancer” in the following catogories: EBV-associated diseases and oncogenesis, virus-cell interaction, cell culture model, synergistic effect between viral and other risk factors, latent infection or the reactivated infection, and abrogation of immunocompetence and tumor progression. Hopefully, the discussion will delineate the plausible reason for the decreasing immunocompetence in patients with NPC and will provide a better explanation for the clinical phenomena as well as the theoretical base for the future design of immunotherapy, gene therapy and immuno-gene therapy.'},\n",

There are three different kinds of phantom to simulate unit-density soft tissue, chest wall with lung, & chest wall with lung and mediastinum, respectively. The definition of penumbra is 20% to 80% dosage of the dose profile in the central plane. We used Kodak V films for recording the different layers of depth in test phantom, that were 2,4,6,8,& 10 cm, respectively. Comparing the size of penumbra between unit-density and lung-density phantom, the Co-60, 6-, and 10-MV X-rays increased -5.4% to -30.9%, -9.7% to 28.3%, and -2.7% to 91.8%, respectively.

In physical point of view, when the energies getting higher (ex. 10-MVX), the size of penumbra within the lung will be more widened than ordinary data. Clinically, if we wanted to use these kinds of energy, we must reserve a larger safe margin around the tumor. Although the lower energy (ex.

This study is to develop an indirect method to accurately verify the oblique infraobital portals. We sent the NPC patient for CT scan with a mask and immobilization devices as in simulation position. Serial axial cuts are used to delineate the tumor margin. A midline is drawn at all cuts of images at the nasopharynx level. Use a paper strip with same magnification rate of 5cm as CT image's as the portal width covering the most nasopharyngeal and parapharyngeal areas, then get the cross point of the portal central line and the midline of axial cuts as the rotation center. Rotate the paper strip in the angle of 40-50 degree bilaterally to cover the nasopharyngeal and parapharyngeal areas on the contralateral side and the most nasopharyngeal and parapharyngeal areas on the ipsilateral side without irradiating the spinal cord. Then rotate the paper strip again to the horizontal (true lateral) position. Mark the posterior margin of the treatment portals on the image of axial cuts. Connect these markers into a line as the posterior margin of true lateral portal. With a suitable collimator angulation and the necessary block making, an indirect method for verification of this position is obtained. This technique allows us to correctly irradiate the oblique infraorbital portal with reliable verification. Applying indirect verification of oblique infraorbital portal in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, is feasible and reliable.

X-ray machine operation and reestablishment of clinical contacts in China convinced Mr. Hodges that he should finish his medical education in the United States. With the acquaintance of the members of the Rockefeller Foundation such as Simon Flexner and Roger Green and the future medical program in China, opportunities were harbored that one day Mr. Hodges would go to mainland China (Peking Union Medical School), University of Chicago, and later to Taiwan (National Defense Medical Center and Veterans General Hospital-Taipei) for teaching and the development of radiology.\"},\n",

Because clonogenic assay in studying drug-radiation interaction is not sensitive enough to detect the viability change caused by low dose radiation, an in vitro apoptotic assay is used to evaluate the synergistic effect of taxol and low dose radiation as well as to arrange the optimal schedule for using taxol in radiotherapy. The growth inhibition curve and radiation survival curve were determined with or without taxol on HeLa cells. HeLa cells were treated with various doses of taxol for 2 or 24 hrs. Radiation of 2Gy was given at various time intervals following taxol treatment. Percentages of apoptotic cells were calculated according to nucleus morphology after propidium iodide staining was counted by fluorescence microscope. The proportion of cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity of taxol is not dose-dependent with killing efficiency most obvious at low dose. However, the increase of apoptotic cells and cells at sub-G1 phase following taxol treatment are correlated with the taxol concentration and the timing to irradiation. The maximal effect of taxol-2Gy combination assessed by percentage of apoptosis and sub-G1 phase proportion was resulted from low dose (IC10) taxol for 2hr and then radiation 24hr later. Under such condition, taxol functioned as a cell-cycle selective radiosensitizer. (Partial supported by VGH 83-158 and D0H84-HR-202)'},\n",

After initial rough planning with 12 shots to cover the tumor, repeated revisions of coordinates and weights of most shots resulted in a 50% isodose curve matching the tumor contour in 3 dimensions. The possibility of neurological complication is low due to the relative low dose (＜30%) to the neighboring optic nerve and brain stem. Though the result of this laborious and prolonged treatment planning is good, the amenity and efficiency of using KULA are unsatisfactory for this large and irregular shaped tumor. When stacking of multiple isocenters or shots in 3 dimensions to fill the tumor volume, the melded isodose curves can be very differnt from the simple combination of individual curves and trials and errors are inevitable. For efficient planning of large and irregular shaped tumors with KULA, it is essential to be familiar with the principle of allocation and methods of fine adjustment of parameters of shots.'},\n",

Taxol 175 mg/m^2 was administered by 3-hour intravenous infusion every three weeks. Patients were evaluated for response and toxicity.\\nResults: Three patients were studied. The first two patients had failed previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The first patient had partial response to Taxol therapy. He tolerated Taxol well. Taxol was escalated to 230 mg/m^2 without G.CSF support. The second patient, a hepatitis B carrier, received one course of Taxol treatment and had stable disease. He tolerated treatment well but developed reactivation of hepatitis B virus with ful-minant hepatitis. The third patient tolerated treatment well but response was too early to be evaluated. The overall toxicities of Taxol treatment were tolerable. The major toxicity was myelosuppression. The dose-limiting toxicity was myalgia in one patient.

Four patients had late sequelae from treatment. One had hemorrhagic cystitis and the other three developed bilateral hydronephrosis due to ureter stenosis. The one-year and two-year actuarial survival rates were 100%and 89% respectively. Our results demonstrate that concomitant cisplatin and irradiation is a tolerable, effective treatment for old-aged patients with invasive bladder cancer. High local control rate and bladder preservation rate can also be achieved by this combined-modality treatment.'},\n",

Clinically, the patient would suffer from lack of adequate venous access for administration of chemotherapeutic agents after multiple courses of chemotherapy. The problem is resolved by the extensive use of venous injection ports. Injection ports are usually implanted in the anterior chest wall, with their catheter inserted into the subclavian vein. If the patient must receive radiotherapy over these areas, the radiation dose under injection ports would be lower. This paper trys to find out the influence of metallic or silicon injection ports on the dose distribution of K-rays and electron beams. Two different kinds of radiation beams, with different energy levels, were used in these experiments. They were 6MV and 10 MV K-rays, and 9, 12, 15 and 18MeV eletron beams. In order to understand the influence of injection ports, all dose measurements were made at different depths under the ports. The data revealed that the presence of injection ports alters the dose uniformity and decreased the depth dose. For example, the dose underlying metal injection portals at 2.5cm depth reduced to 37% when 9MeV electrons are used. This paper recommends that 1.The injection port should be implanted outside the potential irradiation field. 2. Avoid irradiation of the injection port whenever possible. 3. Use silicon-made injections port. 4. Avoid selecting electron beams for treatment.'},\n",
